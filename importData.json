You don't need to have the spell prepared.</p><div></div></div><div><span> <span>Spellcasting Focus.</span></span> <p>You can use an @item[arcane focus|phb] as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p><div></div></div><div><span> <span>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher.</span></span> <p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see \"Your Spellbook\").</p><div></div></div><div><span><h4>Your Spellbook</h4><span><span>[–]</span></span></span><p>The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p><p>A spellbook doesn't contain cantrips.</p><div><div><span> <span>Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></span> <p>When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p><div></div><p>Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p><p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p><div><span> <span>Copying from a Spell Scroll.</span></span> <p>A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When you copy a spell from a spell scroll, you must succeed on an Intelligence (&amp;Reference[skill=Arcana]) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.</p><div></div></div></div><div></div></div><div><div><span> <span>Replacing the Book.</span></span> <p>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p><div></div><p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p></div><div></div></div><div><div><span> <span>The Book's Appearance.</span></span> <p>Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p><div></div></div><div></div></div><div></div></div></div>",

If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.</p><p>Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.</p><p>You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language.</p><p>Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.</p>",

A creature might have been imprisoned as a result of defaulting on a deal, while another might be the victim of a night hag's curse.</p><p><strong>Carrying Soul Coins. </strong>To hold a soul coin is to feel the soul bound within it—overcome with rage or fraught with despair.

Soul coins are created by Mammon and his greater devils on Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells, in a vast chamber where the captured souls of evil mortals are bound into the coins. These coins are then distributed throughout the Nine Hells to be used for goods and services, infernal deals, dark bargains, and bribes.</p><p><strong>Unmake a Soul. </strong>When casting a spell which requires repeated castings for it's effects to become permanent, soul coins can be expended as a material component and the souls trapped inside unmade. Each soul coin expended this way reduces the number of required castings by three.

The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p><div><span> <span>Copying from a Spell Scroll.</span></span> <p>A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When you copy a spell from a spell scroll, you must succeed on an Intelligence (&amp;Reference[skill=Arcana]) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.</p><div></div></div></div><div></div></div><div><div><span> <span>Replacing the Book.</span></span> <p>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p><div></div><p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal.

Each coin weighs one-third of a pound, and is inscribed with Infernal writing and a spell that magically binds a single soul to the coin. Because each soul coin has a unique soul trapped within it, each has a story. A creature might have been imprisoned as a result of defaulting on a deal, while another might be the victim of a night hag's curse.</p><p><strong>Carrying Soul Coins. </strong>To hold a soul coin is to feel the soul bound within it—overcome with rage or fraught with despair. An evil creature can carry as many soul coins as it wishes (up to its maximum weight allowance). A non-evil creature can carry a number of soul coins equal to or less than its Constitution modifier without penalty. A non-evil creature carrying a number of soul coins greater than its Constitution modifier has disadvantage on its attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.</p><p><strong>Freeing a Soul. </strong>Casting a spell that removes a curse on a soul coin frees the soul trapped within it, as does expending all of the coin's charges. The coin itself rusts from within and is destroyed once the soul is released. A freed soul travels to the realm of the god it served or the outer plane most closely tied to its alignment (DM's choice). The souls of lawful evil creatures released from soul coins typically emerge from the River Styx as devils.</p><p><strong>Hellish Currency. </strong>Soul coins are a currency of the Nine Hells and are highly valued by devils. The coins are used among the infernal hierarchy to barter for favours, bribe the unwilling, and reward the faithful for services rendered. Soul coins are created by Mammon and his greater devils on Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells, in a vast chamber where the captured souls of evil mortals are bound into the coins. These coins are then distributed throughout the Nine Hells to be used for goods and services, infernal deals, dark bargains, and bribes.</p><p><strong>Unmake a Soul. </strong>When casting a spell which requires repeated castings for it's effects to become permanent, soul coins can be expended as a material component and the souls trapped inside unmade. Each soul coin expended this way reduces the number of required castings by three. Unmaking a soul is different to freeing it as doing so erases the soul from existence itself, it's essence lost forever.</p>",

Inside, a magnificent white eagle is trapped, its pristine feathers dulled by the shadows. Its sharp eyes search for something—someone—through the haze of its confinement, and when they lock onto yours, a shiver runs down your spine.</p><p>Then, behind the cage, an imposing figure emerges from the darkness: a frost giant, towering and fearsome. Clad in heavy, jagged armor that glimmers like ice under the flickering light, it looms over the eagle, on its head sits a wide-brimmed wizard’s hat.</p><p>You can only watch in horror as the giant raises a massive hand, fingers like icicles curling around the eagle's feathers. One by one, he rips them out with a slow, deliberate cruelty. Each tug is a reminder of pain, and the eagle’s cries pierce your soul—a desperate plea for freedom, a haunting call for mercy that echoes within you.</p><p>As its gaze remains locked onto yours, you see the anguish in its eyes, seeking deliverance from the grip of its captor.

It wrought havoc amongst the devils' ranks but eventually - through their trickery and cunning - it fell into a deep ravine and was never seen again. Over time, the land shifted, and as the ravine closed, holes began to appear in the ground spewing forth black smoke. The devils, curious as to where these vents led, explored them. Only the ones that stayed near the surface returned.</p><p>But when the remains and personal belongings of the others began to fall from the sky in Dis, it became clear that the vents formed a connection between the two planes - and that something lived inside of them.</p><p>In another tale you hear of ten Pit Fiends sent to slay the creature dwelling within the vents. When none returned, Zariel herself took on the task. She did return - bloodied and bruised - and immediately decapitated the first devil who dared ask if she had succeeded. Afterward, she decreed that no devil shall set foot there again, and the entire area has remained off-limits ever since.</p>"

          "content": "<p>Just as Aviana's hand closed around Plex's neck, the goblin's curse took hold once more and transported him into the Feywild - only for Aviana's curse to take hold as well and bring her along.</p><p>The two appeared in the middle of a clearing in a vibrant forest, and surrounded by a few dozen Satyrs who're dancing, drinking, playing music, and partying. Their music suddenly stopped however once they got interrupted by Plex's choking gasps for air and Aviana's \"Listen here you little shit...\".</p><p>The satyrs clearly weren't amused and what followed was an honest effort of diplomacy from Aviana. Which was interrupted only briefly when she noticed that she was still holding Plex aloft by his throat, and that this particular image probably wasn't helping her diplomatic efforts. So she let the goblin go, who immediately teleported away from Aviana. Or rather tried to, as his first attempt resulted in him just teleporting from Aviana's left to her right. The 2nd attempt that followed was successful however and Aviana lost sight of the goblin.</p><p> </p><p>She continued her efforts to make peace with the satyrs but was having a tough time as she made one social faux pas (in the satyr's eyes that is) after another. When Aviana saw the rainbow-colored glow and heard the bleats coming from the forest's edge, she immediately knew what was to come and instantly regretted ever letting go of Plex's neck. The Lantern Goat stormed onto the clearing with Plex on it's back holding onto its horns for dear life. Now that was the kind of diplomacy the satyrs could get behind, and soon the music, dancing, and drinking started again, with Aviana, Plex, and the Lantern Goat as guests of honour. </p><p>All were having a good time until Aviana couldn't restrain herself any longer. The large boulder at the edge of the clearing was the first thing she noticed when she arrived here and she instantly knew that not lifting it would be something she'd regret for the rest of her life. The boulder's bizarre shape just made it even more intriguing, as it reminded her a lot of a giant goat's head. So she went over, grabbed it, and - didn't lift it. \"Strange\", she thought to herself and tried again, putting all of her strength into the lift. Much to her satisfaction, the boulder moved.</p><p>Much to her, and everyone else's, dissatisfaction however, it wasn't just the boulder that moved. The earth beneath the clearing shook and rose, higher and higher, until all could see the tops of the trees beneath them. Off in the distance, Aviana even saw a large patch of forest was completely grey. She didn't have much opportunity to ponder that however, as the head-like boulder she tried to lift turned out to be an actual head after all. Namely the head of a mythical Mountain Goat, who had been slumbering for eons. Who was very displeased with Aviana's attempts to tear its head off.</p><p>A fight for survival ensued as the Mountain Goat bucked and shook. The satyrs tried to hold on but one by one they fell off the Mountain Goat's back, disappearing into the treetops below with a scream. Plex wasn't having any issues himself as he had correctly figured that a goat wouldn't have any issues standing on another goat, and so he had once again climbed onto the Lantern Goat's back. Due to his growing experience with using unwilling Lantern Goats as mounts, he was finding it easier and easier to hold on. This even allowed him to save several of the satyrs from certain death, as he teleported them safely to the ground.</p><p>Aviana, unwilling - and unable - to let go of ~~her boulder~~ the Mountain Goat's head, looked for a way to resolve this situation and the first solution that came to her mind was, unsurprisingly, the broken Iron Flask. She grabbed it from her pockets and threw it at the Mountain Goat - and missed. Plex, witnessing Aviana's valiant attempt from the relative safety of the Lantern Goat's back, couldn't help but be impressed by Aviana's ability to miss a creature the size of a small mountain as he saw the small bottle plummet into the forest below - only to be followed by Aviana, who had no intentions of losing her precious Iron Flask.</p><p>Figuring it was a good time for him to leave as well, he teleported himself and the Lantern Goat down to the ground where Aviana was frantically searching for her Iron Flask. After a few minutes of searching - while fighting off the Mountain Goat's attempts to trample her - she eventually found her Iron Flask and noticed that the brass stopper was firmly closed. Before she had time to wonder what was now inside the flask, the Mountain Goat's hoof stomped down and Aviana barely managed to turn around and catch it. The weight of the colossal creature made her sink into the ground but she didn't budge. Getting stomped to death by a giant goat was not how she planned to die!</p><p>The Lantern Goat Plex was riding - or rather was trying to ride as he had no way of controlling it - was about to run past Aviana and the Goblin figured this was a good an opportunity to leave as they were gonna get. He just needed a moment to cast a spell - and for that his mount would have to be still for even a second. He shouted at Aviana and the conversation that followed went something like this: </p><p>Plex: \"Hold the goat!\"</p><p>Aviana: \"I AM! CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?\" </p><p>Lantern Goat: \"Bleeee!\"</p><p>Mountain Goat ( *very annoyed*): \"**BLEEEEEEE**\"</p><p>Plex: \"Nooo, the other goat!\"</p><p>Aviana ( *also very annoyed*): \"LISTEN HERE YOU LITTLE SHIT...\"</p><p>Lantern Goat: \"Bleeee???\"</p><p>And so Aviana grabbed the Lantern Goat's horn as it ran past, now holding up the Mountain Goat's weight with just one hand. Plex used this moment to open a teleportation gate in the ground beneath them and he, Aviana, and the Lanter Goat all fell through. A few hundred feet away, at the other end of the gate, Aviana got launched several hundred feet into the air as the force of the Mountain Goat's hoof pushed her through. Her fall back down was slowed by several tree branches so she was barely falling anymore when she landed on the ground. Plex, pleased with his efforts to save himself, Aviana and, most importantly, the Lantern Goat, realised that the Mountain Goat was still coming for them. And that he would very much like Fearghas to see it...</p><p>When Plex felt Aviana's hand tighten around his neck like a vice once more, he felt the weave around him snap as her action caused a wild magic surge. The world around Plex twisted and he felt like his stomach was pulled through his nose - the oh so familiar feeling of unwilling planar teleportation.</p>"

The wizard, another human muffled in an embroidered purple cloak, led the way with growing excitement. The others did not come close to sharing his sentiment.</p><p>\"It's too cold,\" the knight said, holding his shield to protect the Halfling from the biting winds. \"Naami won't make it.\"</p><p>\"Don't worry about me,\" she muttered through her scarf.</p><p>\"That's the spirit! Think of the wonders that await us in the ruins,\" Daman exclaimed. \"Ancient magic, forgotten glyphs, records of feats nowadays only dreamed of! This blizzard is surely conjured up by their runes, to protect the temple. The ancient people -\"</p><p>They never learnt what Daman was about to say about the ancient people, as he was silenced in the middle of his tirade by snow swirling into his mouth. Coughing and cursing, he turned to face forward again, stomping as if to beat the ice into submission.</p><p>\"It's wrong,\" the dwarf said, shaking his head. \"The ancients' magic cost me my right hand, and he wants *more* of that?\"</p><p>\"Seeking knowledge is not wrong in itself,\" Osten said firmly. \"But the price he is willing to pay to get it... *that* is wrong.\"</p><p>He held out his hand to help Naami stand after she stumbled face first in the snow. The small healer endured bravely, but for someone who had spent most of her life in a desert, the climate proved a bigger threat than to the rest of them.</p><p>\"It's fine,\" she said. \"When we get back, I'll make us hot tea and we can warm ourselves by the fire.\"</p><p>\"When we get back,\" Osten said, \"I'll make us tea while you warm yourself.\"</p><p>\"If we get back,\" Magnus grumbled. \"The blizzard is only growing worse. It's madness to be out in this. Nature is fighting our every step.\"</p><p>Daman yelped and ran back a few steps, stammering about something in the snow. Osten signalled to Magnus and he nodded, stepping closer to Naami. The knight advanced to where Daman had stood, and went still. He slowly raised his shield.</p><p>\"We have a problem,\" he said in a voice that barely reached to the rest of the party. \"Stench of rotting flesh in a blizzard. We've entered the territory of -\"</p><p>A red flash burst from the snow, whipping at Osten. He blocked with an oath, his boots digging into the snow under the force of the impact. Just in front of him, an ominous silhouette emerged. It was darker than the ice, tinged with blue like a deep frozen lake. Taller than a pillar, it grew a mass of blood-red tendrils near the top. The one that had hit Osten retreated, and the creature resolved into a gigantic slug, its head and back covered in crystals.</p><p>\"What in the world is *that*?\" Naami squeaked.</p><p>\"Rime worm,\" Osten growled. \"We've stumbled into their territory. We're prey now.\"</p><p>As if to give reason to the knight's words, the slug collapsed on top of him, dark maw gaping. Osten activated the magic in his shield; blue light pulsed in a shockwave, barely repelling the monster. He thrust with his sword, burying it into the creature's mouth. The rime worm recoiled with a howl that was more vibration than audible noise, rattling Naami's teeth.</p><p>\"Monsters from cold climes, right?\" Magnus asked, but did not wait for an answer. \"That thing must be weak to fire!\"</p><p>He held his staff aloft, a length of ash carved so it still seemed to be living and growing. From the tip, fire sparked into existence and streaked towards the slug. It sizzled as it hit, black smoke billowing from the impact. The rime worm reared into the air, tendrils lashing at the snow, then its body began to loom over the party.</p><p>\"It's going to crush us, fall back!\" Osten cried.</p><p>The two spellcasters obeyed, but Naami stepped forward instead. She had taken her gloves off, and her fingers traced sigils in the freezing air, precise patterns to guide her magic. The ominous shadow of the rime worm over Osten blurred and twisted, then leapt up and wound around its owner's body. Hands clenched into fists, the Halfling planted her feet into the snow.</p><p>\"Can't hold the spell very long,\" she said through gritted teeth.</p><p>\"I will protect you!\" Osten said. \"We can buy them time.\"</p><p>Behind them, Magnus and Daman stood close, threads of magic twining around them. Daman held his book close to his chest, speaking incantations in a clear voice. The words wrapped around a ball of flame hovering atop Magnus' staff.</p><p>\"Now!\" The dwarf said.</p><p>With a flick of his wrist, Magnus passed the fireball to Daman. The human's spell took in the blaze, and propelled it towards the slug at a speed Magnus alone would have been unable of. The burning ball hit the monster square in the face, sending it into a rage.</p><p>\"It survived that?\" The Halfling cried in disbelief.</p><p>\"Naami, watch out!\"</p><p>The knight threw himself in front of his friend, just in time to block several tendrils streaking towards her. They made a fleshy thud on his shield, but the sheer force of the attack forced Osten to his knees. He groaned, his voice raising into a scream as his shield arm fell limp to his side.</p><p>\"Osten!\" Naami's weaves snapped, her spell's hold on the rime worm fading.</p><p>Suddenly free, the monster crawled towards her, opening its maw wide. Osten scrambled to his feet, face white with pain. Naami reached out to him without thinking, her magic washing over her friend's body. Her powerful healing mended the broken bones, and Osten stood tall once more. With a nod of gratitude, he raised his shield. The mages at the back were channelling a new spell, combining the wildfire of Magnus' magic with Daman's years of obsessive study and his extensive knowledge of physics. One more spell would kill the monster. It had to.</p><p>Osten stood ready to block another attempt to devour him or Naami, but the slug did not fall forward this time. Inside the open maw, a sickly light flickered and grew, then took the shape of dark icicles, sharpened to a needle point.</p><p>\"This thing has magic?\" Naami cried, her stomach filled with dread.</p><p>\"Get behind me!\" Osten said.</p><p>He spared a second to smile at her over his shoulder before turning to face the monster, his shoulders squared, ready to endure anything. Behind Naami, magic swelled and shaped into another offensive spell. She wanted to close her eyes but she began to weave another healing spell instead, preparing to mend the inevitable wounds. A hail of frozen spikes rushed towards Osten; the magic of his shield expanded in a blue dome to protect them all. Black ice pelted the barrier in a blinding flash of magic. Naami's eyes exploded in pain as if they had been pierced by the spikes. She was only aware of magic for a dizzying moment; the shield's magic above her head, the rime worm's attack, the combined spell bursting into existence behind her. The spell rushed past her just as she recovered her vision, a ray of white-hot flame exploding on the slug's body. It gave one last reverberating howl and crashed onto the rocky ground, shuddering into stillness. Deafening silence swallowed the din of battle. They had won.</p><p>\"It's... dead?\" Daman said, spellbook trembling in his hands.</p><p>Magnus sank to his knees, beard full of ice, his hands reaching down to the earth beneath the snow. Naami released her spell, letting a web of positive energy settle on her friends. She was dimly aware of strength returning to Magnus' legs, of Daman's hands growing steadier. From Osten, she sensed nothing. Her heart went cold. He had fallen on his side with his shield arm at an unnatural angle, but her healing did not touch him. She made herself take a step towards him, then another, and each new step was infinitely heavier than the last. Deep down, she knew. Her spells never failed. She knew, but she could not accept it.</p><p>Her friend was dead. Dirt-blonde hair seemed dark against his face; his sapphire eyes stared at the sky. His pale eyelashes had frozen, and his armour was so covered in frost as to seem made of ice. A jolt of pain in her knees told Naami her legs had failed her. The pain of her body was distant, an annoyance that had no right to exist beside the agony in her heart. Osten had protected her in a world gone from wonderful to terrifying. Osten had shared tea with her on nights where the cold could have split the very mountains. Osten had always had a kind word, a smile, an encouraging gesture. Naami sensed Magnus and Daman on either side of her, kneeling in silence. She could not bear their sorrow. She heard it in their silence, in the lack of words from friends who were never quiet. Their silence was another drop in a sea of pain, and yet it was too much. She had to break it, before it broke her too.</p><p>\"I can bring him back.\"</p><p>Naami realised she had spoken aloud. Stunned, she listened to the echo of her words in the frozen air. Her heart pounded in her chest, trying to break her ribs. Her legs would not move. She could barely feel her fingers from the cold, but she knew she had not only spoken from the depths of her heart; she had told the truth.</p><p>\"Naami...\" Magnus reached out to her with the stump of his right hand. \"You're a powerful healer, you gave it your all, but you must not push yourself so. No one blames you.\"</p><p>\"The amount of magic that would take... it is impossible,\" Daman said in the voice of a lecturer; as if he would ever have the patience for teaching. \"We'll give him the proper rites, and take care of the living.\"</p><p>She clenched her teeth. They thought she was losing her mind, but she knew. As she had known Osten was dead, she knew she could bring him back.</p><p>\"I'm serious,\" she said. \"I need time, but I can do it.\"</p><p>She had to crane her neck to look at Daman, but she put all her resolve into that look. He knew the rules of magic better than she ever would, yes. But he was not a witch, and none of his theory could explain why she needed her spellwards to function, the same as she could not use his spellbook for as much as lighting a candle. He did not understand how her magic worked. She hardly understood her own magic, for the matter; she only felt that it would work. The gods be thanked, Daman saw she meant it. With a sigh, he rose to his feet and opened his book.</p><p>\"I maintain we don't have enough magic. No sacrifice to make. But if you wish to try, then I will shield you from the elements.\"</p><p>He spoke as a king granting a favour to a commoner. In spite of herself, Naami grinned. Daman had a flamboyant manner, dominating a room with his presence despite his light build. This grand manner of speaking was just like him. Somehow this piece of \"normal\" opened a crack in the pain of her heart. Magnus merely gestured with his left hand, effortlessly conjuring a flame in mid-air.</p><p>\"You'll need some warmth to move these fingers,\" he said gruffly. \"I'll be looking at how you do it, if you don't mind me.\"</p><p>Naami surprised herself by giggling. \"I expect as much. Thank you.\"</p><p>The dwarf nodded, a shadow of a smile hiding in his beard. He began melting the snow with his magical flame while Daman walked in a perfect circle around them, muttering incantations. Slowly the magic shifted in his wake, the air becoming warm and dry. A bubble enveloped the party, the snow sliding off the invisible barrier. Magnus' flames melted the flakes before they could bury the party's shelter. A piece of rough stone ground appeared as the snow was cleared. It would make an uncomfortable seat, but Naami sat by Osten nonetheless, crossing her legs under her heavy skirts. Her mind returned to her desert home; when she closed her eyes, she could imagine she was back in Ildilas. Of course Osten had never set foot on Bottleneck Coast. Maybe one day, he would. If she could only reach out to his soul... Naami shut out the world. She flexed her numb fingers and paused for a moment, feeling the smooth bands of the bangles which allowed her to control magic without being consumed by it. She made her breathing steady, made her mind calm, and she took off her spellwards.</p><p>Resting her fingers on Osten's chest, she cast out her mind far from the confines of her body. She searched the aether for a trace of Osten's soul, for the warmth she was now familiar with. Her mind wandered, little more than a vague sense of self in the darkness. She sensed sparks of life, but none felt like her friend. It was much too soon to give up, however. As an Ildic witch, one the omens had smiled on, she was acquainted with the veil between light and darkness, life and death. She strayed closer, calling out to Osten.</p><p>\"Come back,\" she said in her trance. \"Your story isn't over yet, so come back.\"</p><p>Silence answered her. This was not right; if Osten's soul had sensed her presence, it would have echoed her words. She could not explain how, but she knew. She called out again, to no avail. Letting silence embrace her, she allowed her mind to sink into motionlessness. A breath of cold touched her cheek; it was infinitely distant. Her body seemed to wait on the other shore of a dark sea, but the cold helped. Silence, stillness, and stasis had always strengthened her magic, until the moment she spoke the spell. Part of her sensed the danger of staying here, mind and body separate. Stay too long, and she would not find her way back. She ignored the risks. Instead of calling out to Osten, she merely thought of him, of his soul. Her own soul began to shift, like colour gradually changing, a wavelength slowly altering. It hurt; even as she was now, without a body, the shift made her ache more with each passing second. Intuition spurring her on, she persevered through the pain.</p><p>Responding to the paralysing ache, an echo touched her consciousness. Naami was so startled she nearly lost concentration, but she recovered in time to cling to the fading echo. It was Osten, but it also was not him. While she recognised his soul, it was so terribly far, so different from hers that it might as well come from another world. It was hollow and confused, missing part of what made him who he was.</p><p>\"Don't go,\" she pleaded.</p><p>Pain washed over her in response, a hollow ache so strong she could have screamed. Like having her heart ripped out. She held onto it, sensing the answer lay this way. She made herself go closer to the pain, made the wavelength of her soul change further. She adjusted herself to the ache, embraced it, wishing she could cry. Within the pain was a sense of hunger, of yearning, stronger than she had ever known. It was on the edge of consuming her; she kept the most tenuous grip on her consciousness.</p><p>\"Naami?\"</p><p>Osten's voice. She would have burst into tears had she been able. She tried to respond through the pain, but she had no voice. The veil was a wall now, and the voice on the other side was entirely alien. She was a cloud trying to speak to a person. Holding on by a fingernail, she communicated the only way she could think of; by altering the emotion suffusing the ache threatening to tear her apart. She fed it all the pain she had ever felt, the grief, the loss. She gave it her own wishes, her yearning for the next sunrise. With a sharp click, the emotions within her aligned with those in Osten's soul. It shook her mind but she held on tight, the memories of her friend lending her strength. Now that there was a connection through the wall, which was the veil between this life and the next, she could speak to him. The words mattered very little in this space; emotion and magic carried the message. A whole world away, she heard a whisper come from her body.</p><p>\"We miss you already. Come back.\"</p><p>Voices answered, so distant she only barely made them out.</p><p>\"It... is impossible... magic wants a sacrifice... how is she doing this...\"</p><p>\"She is paying the cost. The sacrifice... is her.\"</p><p>The voices faded, Osten's presence growing clearer.</p><p>\"Come with me instead. Pharasma calls to me. I'm drawn to a wide river. I don't want to go alone.\"</p><p>\"You don't have to go,\" she said. \"Come back with me.\"</p><p>\"I'm afraid, Naami.\"</p><p>\"Then follow me! We can go home.\"</p><p>\"But the sound of battle is finally gone. I think... if I sink into the river, I will be at peace for the first time.\"</p><p>\"If you go to the river, I will never see you again,\" Naami cried.</p><p>If Osten went to the River of Souls, he would finally know peace. Osten had lived a life of battles, until he made his last stand to protect his friends. He had earned his peace and rest. Tearing him from a realm where his soul would know quiet at last... that would be nothing short of cruelty. *Sometimes a healer must inflict pain*, Naami's mother had said when she was teaching her, a lifetime ago. Setting a bone would always hurt. Bitter herbs made you think you truly would do better without them. It was nothing, compared to robbing a soul of the peace it so deeply deserved... but the principle was the same. Naami was Osten's friend, but she was a healer, too. And... she missed him.</p><p>\"Come back. Death will meet you later, but we are here now. We miss you. Let's spend just another day together, and if the gods allow it, another after that. Death will embrace you when our story is over.\"</p><p>No matter how long or painful the journey, it would have an end. It was a comforting thought. There would be quiet at the end, so why not make a little more noise in the meantime? Naami's thin grasp on consciousness was overwhelmed with warmth, with the feeling of Osten's smile. Had she had a body in this strange place, she would have opened her arms to hug him, to welcome him back. She would do it soon. His soul phased through the veil which was a wall for her, away from the River of Souls, far from the call of the Spiral of Fate. Side by side in a dream of twilight, they returned from a battle that had taken place in their hearts.</p><p>Naami woke to pain, her body burning. Her hands on Osten's chest felt as though severed from her body, lumps of flesh she could not command. A sliver of sensation remained, enough to know her fingers were ablaze with pain. Her head was light and heavy, her thoughts drowning within themselves. Breathing was agony, but there was just one last thing to do. One task left, and then she could rest. She smiled through the pain, gathered her magic, and settled it on Osten's body. Her magic whispered to his heart, reminded it of the beat of life. Her magic caught a wisp of air, leading it into her friend's still lungs. She guided the blood back into his veins, and when his body was restored to life, she gave his soul one last invitation.</p><p>\"Come back to us, Osten.\"</p><p>As the knight's eyes opened, magic escaped Naami's control. It leapt from her, humming and dancing. A warm breeze laughed around the party, and flowers burst into existence beneath them and around them, a carpet of wild colours. She recognised none of the blossoms, and the ones who grew outside of Daman's barrier froze in a heartbeat, turning dark and stiff with ice. Inside the barrier, the rock was covered in vibrant colours, the air saturated with sweet scents.</p><p>\"The magic...\" Naami murmured.</p><p>When no one said anything, she looked at her friends. Osten was sitting up, still pale as death, a confused look in his eyes. Magnus was looking down at his left hand, and more intensely at the stump of his right hand. Daman had sunk to his knees, eyes wide, his usual charisma shattered.</p><p>\"I saw... I was...\" Osten began, voice hoarse. \"Scales on my arms, bestial strength in them... I had claws... and the breath of winter in my chest... I was... What was I...?\"</p><p>\"I had a right hand again,\" Magnus said, \"but it was different... wrong. And yet it felt like it was made for me, better than the one I had before. Dark magic around it... strange... my flames always burned so bright... it felt like home... but how...\"</p><p>Daman was pale as the snow outside the barrier. His mouth moved soundlessly at first, unable to form words.</p><p>\"The void,\" he said finally, his voice thin and weak. \"Gods save us, the void is coming.\"</p><p>His eyes rolled back into his head and he crumpled in a faint. Naami tried to go to him to revive him, but exhaustion crashed down on her. Her head spun, and before she knew it, she was in Magnus' arms. His right arm was stiff as wood, but he held her gently. She realised she could not move, her strength entirely spent.</p><p>\"Easy there,\" he said, the cold in his voice fading as he spoke. \"You were sitting here for a full hour. You've done the impossible. Take a break.\"</p><p>The impossible. He was right. She had cast a spell that demands a sacrifice, without paying that cost. But then, she thought as she glimpsed her spellwards on the ground, maybe she had merely found another way to pay the cost for that magic; a way only a witch could find. She feebly reached out towards her bracelets. Osten handed them out to her. Colour was returning to his face; he breathed deeply as if relishing the very sensation.</p><p>\"It's a strange dream I woke from,\" he said with a smile. \"I think we all saw things, too. I'm not sure I want to know what Daman saw.\"</p><p>\"Whatever it was, it's of no concern to us right now,\" Magnus grumbled. \"There are more pressing matters. Slapping some life back into Daman, so we can be on our way. He'll talk when he feels like it, or he won't. Hopefully someone will pay us for killing this thing; nature is relieved by its death, at least. All I want now is mulled wine, my bones are frozen.\"</p><p>\"I feel warmer, somehow,\" Osten said. \"Like a deep cold inside me has been denied... turned away.\"</p><p>\"Let's make it so it stays away,\" Magnus said, shuffling through the wild flowers towards Daman.</p><p>Naami grinned. She had a feeling that she would see stranger things the next day. And, if the gods allowed it, she would see even stranger things the day after that.</p>"

Though the transition was not unfamiliar, something about it this time felt unsettling, as if the very essence of the realm had shifted.</p><p>When he opened his eyes, the usual kaleidoscope of vibrant, overwhelming colors did not greet him. Instead, a strange dullness had taken hold of the landscape, as though the world around him was slowly fading, its once brilliant hues bleeding away into shades of gray.</p><p>For a day, perhaps two, Plex wandered through this muted wilderness. He gathered curious and rare materials, though the joy of discovery felt unusually distant. Eventually, as he crossed a shimmering river, he encountered a Nereid.</p><p>It was Aranei, a familiar figure from Mennon's court, her uncanny beauty seeming diminished in this colorless light. She spoke of a strange veil that had descended upon Mennon’s palace and the surrounding lands—a veil that sapped not only color but also joy from everything it touched. The court had fallen into disarray, and the Dark Hunt, had been postponed indefinitely. \"Far more pressing matters claim our attention now,\" Mennon had said in an unusually cryptic tone, laced with urgency.</p><p>Those of lesser strength within the court had been urged to flee, and Aranei had done so, retreating into the wild rivers she called home. As she fled, she noticed with dread that the veil was expanding, creeping outward like a living thing, muting colors, light, and joy as it spread.</p><p>Before Aranei could finish her tale, Plex felt the familiar tug of planar magic once again.

          "content": "<h2>Meeting Familiar Faces</h2><p>One moment Plex was in the middle of adjusting his gear, grumbling to himself about the ever-present dust in the lich's former lair, and the next—a hefty sneeze exploded from him. In that instant, the curse took hold, twisting reality around him in a familiar, disorienting flash.</p><p>The ground beneath his feet vanished, and with a jolt, he found himself standing amidst the chaotic beauty of the Feywild. It wasn’t his first time, nor would it likely be the last, but the sudden teleportation left him cursing the fates as he stumbled through the colourful, shifting landscape. The fact that the world around him was full of colour and life, and not covered in a grey veil like it had been the last time, was a relieving realisation.</p><p>After several days of wandering, his aimless journey brought him to a vast lake, its waters a shimmering cascade of colours that reflected the ever-changing skies above. At its center, a town floated on the lake's surface—an intricate network of platforms and bridges, held aloft by some ancient magic. The town was mostly inhabited by elves, their buildings graceful and elegant, seeming to glide with the gentle waves. Curious and with little else to do, Plex swam his way over to the town.</p><p>It was there that he encountered Antx and Prantx. The goblin twins had arrived just a few days before him and were lingering at the edge of town, trying to stay out of sight of the more suspicious elves. The town’s residents hadn’t been too keen on allowing the goblins to remain, seeing them as troublemakers who didn’t belong among their refined society. But after some tense negotiations, Prantx had managed to convince the elves to let them stay, offering his skills as a blacksmith in exchange for shelter. His craftsmanship was impressive enough to win them a begrudging place within the floating community.</p><p>When Plex approached them, the two goblins were quick to strike up a deal, exchanging a few small trinkets they had acquired during their travels in return for some basic supplies Plex had been carrying. It was after the trade that the twins shared their story of a recent incident with him.</p><h2>The Brothers' Story</h2><p>Antx and Prantx described the strange series of events with a certain level of disbelief, as if recounting a fevered dream that hadn't yet faded from their minds.</p><p>It had started when they got teleported into a region of the Feywild that wasn’t like anything they had ever seen before. The air was thick with a mist that seemed alive. It wasn’t like ordinary fog—this mist clung to everything, swallowing the vibrant colours that normally defined the Feywild. The greens of the trees, the brilliant blues of the sky, even the shimmering hues of their own skin seemed to fade. The world around them became dull, bleached of its usual lustre.</p><p>In the middle of this eerie, washed-out landscape, they found it—a lantern, standing alone amidst the fog. It was old and weathered, but something about it drew them in. There was a sensation, a pull, like the lantern was whispering to them, calling them closer. Neither of them could explain why, but they felt compelled to touch it.</p><p>The moment their hands made contact, the world twisted around them, folding in on itself. The colours that had been drained from the surroundings seemed to rush inward, converging on the lantern, before exploding into a blinding flash of light. When the light faded, they were no longer in the Feywild.</p><p>Instead, they found themselves in a clearing unlike anything they had ever known. The trees were twisted and dead, their branches brittle and sharp like claws against the perpetually dim sky. Above them hung a full moon, heavy and cold, but there were no stars, no sun—just an endless night. And no matter how much time passed, the moon remained still, locked in its position high above.</p><p>The clearing itself was small and unnervingly quiet. At its centre stood another lantern, eerily similar to the one they had touched. Unlike the lantern in the Feywild, this one didn’t drain colours. It was still, almost tranquil, but as they watched, a small, flickering mote of light formed within it. The mote wasn’t like the dim glow of the moon—it was vivid, almost painfully so, as if it had taken all the stolen colours of the Feywild and concentrated them into this single point of light.</p><p>Without hesitation, the mote drifted out of the lantern and began to float toward the forest, moving slowly but purposefully. It was the only thing that seemed alive in this dead, barren place. Antx and Prantx had considered following it, but the dark, oppressive forest felt too vast, too filled with unknown dangers.</p><p>Before they could make a decision, their curse took hold. Instinctively, both brothers reached out to the lantern on the clearing and held onto it, even though they knew full well it wouldn't stop the teleportation. Then they were ripped away from that strange clearing, transported back to the Feywild in what seemed like an instant. The moment they appeared again, the vibrant colours of the Feywild flooded their senses, and the oppressive feeling of the dead forest faded, though the memory of it lingered.</p><p>To their surprise, two were still holding onto the lantern they had just grabbed. After making sure it wasn't draining any colours from them, they decided to hold onto it to give it to someone who might know better what to do with it. And so they were relieved to meet Plex - after all, who else could have been better suited for such a task than the wise shaman of their tribe?</p>"

Mennon is annoyed since few of the creatures living around Titania's court welcome him, and they are making his search unnecessary difficult. Therefore he wants Plex, who is less known to sneak in and search for her. as a thanks he will let Plex borrow two of his new servants, Antx and Parnatx. </p><p>So Plex and his two tribe members travel towards the court of Titania. On there way Plex, Antx and Parnatx, discuss the the ritual that bound Antx and Parnatx together and the curse Elsa placed on them. Apparently the curse have started to become stronger, and are now teleporting Antx and Parnatx to other planes as well. For strategic reasons they therefor decided to try to also bind Plex to the two of them to increase their chanse of survival. However, it doesn't go as planed and the ritual fails multiple times during several Sleep cycles before they have to give up on the idea. It wasn't all for naught tho, since during there experimentation Plex manages to cook up a new spell instead. </p><p>A while later they arrive in a happy field in Titania court, filled with Pink and red flowers. Through the field cuts a luminous river that blocks the trios path. However the other side of the river is suspiciously quiet which worries Plex. They decides to follow the river, searching for a safer place to cross the river, when they come to a small settlement of frog-like creatures. Plex is greeted by a tribe of Bagiennik (a race of toad people with innate healing abilities concentrated in their snot) that are camping by the riverside. </p><p>They explain that they are searching for a white flower with innate healing abilities, but they are equally worried about the foreboding silence up ahead. They ask the trio to fetch the flowers for them and in return they are willing to share some of their magic knowledge.The trio agree and heads out into the silent field, picking white flowers, when Plex notices that the field is littered with patches of withered and frozen flowers.</p><p>He doesn't have much time to speculate on it tho, as they are suddenly ambushed by a group of Calpinas (insect like creatures who eat charisma form their pray) . The trio manages to fend of the insects and even capture one of them. After some interrogation Plex learns that the insects uses the magical flowers as a lure to catch unsuspecting pray. And that their numbers used to be much higher before they made the critical mistake to attack a Hag with her entourage that passed through, which Plex assumes was Elsa.</p><p>Plex also learned that soon thereafter almost no creatures entered the fields agin leaving them starving. But before Plex could squeeze out any more information, Antx and Parnatx disappeared, which gave the Calpina an opportunity to escape. Returning to the frog people with the magical flowers Plex was rewarded with a new feat and some bottles of snot.Here he also learned that there was no reason to search for Titania, as she and her entire court had diapered a while back. </p><p>Armed with the new information Plex heads back towards Mennon, but he is distracted by a \"Lantern goat\" (a goat that uses its lantern to lure and capture nearby souls on there way to the afterlife for consumption), that crosses his path. Plex hasn't given up on the idea to have a goat as his personal spy. So in an attempt to capture the goat, Plex sets up a trap and prepares a big net, readying himself to ambush the lantern goat. As the goat walks in to his trap Plex leaps towards the goat and tries to grab its horns. [and then he leaves the Fey-wilds]</p>"

While some might be willing to climb through a window, fewer would be willing to pay for it.

After evading the guards for a while, naturally causing more chaos on the way, he noticed a black raven circling above and seemingly following him. Distracted by having to dodge an oar swung at him by a fisher who was not happy to see Plex standing in the middle of his catch, Plex lost sight of the raven for a moment.</p><p>Minutes later, after momentarily shaking off his pursuers, he found himself inside a narrow alleyway when the black raven appeared again. This time the animal landed next to Plex and dropped a piece of parchment it had been carrying in his beak in front of Plex's feet before flying away again.</p><p>When Plex read the parchment he watched as the ink lifted itself off the page, flew towards his spellbook, and inscribed a new spell into it, all in the blink of an eye. Only very little ink remained on the parchment of the scroll, spelling out the words: \"A little token of appreciation from a fellow admirer of chaos. Good lu-\" <br>Plex's head snapped to the side as he suddenly heard a loud thump at the entrance of the alleyway, only to see it blocked by the large figure of another guard.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, Plex enjoyed the view of the city of Utgard beneath him, with the cold and stormy ocean to one side and a seemingly endless stretch of glacier-covered mountains to the other. His enjoyment of the view was only slightly hampered by the fact he was holding on for dear life, clinging onto the feathers of a seagull that was very unhappy about being used as a mount...</p>"

          "content": "<p>Just as Aviana's hand closed around Plex's neck, the goblin's curse took hold once more and transported him into the Feywild - only for Aviana's curse to take hold as well and bring her along.</p><p>The two appeared in the middle of a clearing in a vibrant forest, and surrounded by a few dozen Satyrs who're dancing, drinking, playing music, and partying. Their music suddenly stopped however once they got interrupted by Plex's choking gasps for air and Aviana's \"Listen here you little shit...\".</p><p>The satyrs clearly weren't amused and what followed was an honest effort of diplomacy from Aviana. Which was interrupted only briefly when she noticed that she was still holding Plex aloft by his throat, and that this particular image probably wasn't helping her diplomatic efforts. So she let the goblin go, who immediately teleported away from Aviana. Or rather tried to, as his first attempt resulted in him just teleporting from Aviana's left to her right. The 2nd attempt that followed was successful however and Aviana lost sight of the goblin.</p><p> </p><p>She continued her efforts to make peace with the satyrs but was having a tough time as she made one social faux pas (in the satyr's eyes that is) after another. When Aviana saw the rainbow-colored glow and heard the bleats coming from the forest's edge, she immediately knew what was to come and instantly regretted ever letting go of Plex's neck. The Lantern Goat stormed onto the clearing with Plex on it's back holding onto its horns for dear life. Now that was the kind of diplomacy the satyrs could get behind, and soon the music, dancing, and drinking started again, with Aviana, Plex, and the Lantern Goat as guests of honour. </p><p>All were having a good time until Aviana couldn't restrain herself any longer. The large boulder at the edge of the clearing was the first thing she noticed when she arrived here and she instantly knew that not lifting it would be something she'd regret for the rest of her life. The boulder's bizarre shape just made it even more intriguing, as it reminded her a lot of a giant goat's head. So she went over, grabbed it, and - didn't lift it. \"Strange\", she thought to herself and tried again, putting all of her strength into the lift. Much to her satisfaction, the boulder moved.</p><p>Much to her, and everyone else's, dissatisfaction however, it wasn't just the boulder that moved. The earth beneath the clearing shook and rose, higher and higher, until all could see the tops of the trees beneath them. Off in the distance, Aviana even saw a large patch of forest was completely grey. She didn't have much opportunity to ponder that however, as the head-like boulder she tried to lift turned out to be an actual head after all. Namely the head of a mythical Mountain Goat, who had been slumbering for eons. Who was very displeased with Aviana's attempts to tear its head off.</p><p>A fight for survival ensued as the Mountain Goat bucked and shook. The satyrs tried to hold on but one by one they fell off the Mountain Goat's back, disappearing into the treetops below with a scream. Plex wasn't having any issues himself as he had correctly figured that a goat wouldn't have any issues standing on another goat, and so he had once again climbed onto the Lantern Goat's back. Due to his growing experience with using unwilling Lantern Goats as mounts, he was finding it easier and easier to hold on. This even allowed him to save several of the satyrs from certain death, as he teleported them safely to the ground.</p><p>Aviana, unwilling - and unable - to let go of ~~her boulder~~ the Mountain Goat's head, looked for a way to resolve this situation and the first solution that came to her mind was, unsurprisingly, the broken Iron Flask. She grabbed it from her pockets and threw it at the Mountain Goat - and missed. Plex, witnessing Aviana's valiant attempt from the relative safety of the Lantern Goat's back, couldn't help but be impressed by Aviana's ability to miss a creature the size of a small mountain as he saw the small bottle plummet into the forest below - only to be followed by Aviana, who had no intentions of losing her precious Iron Flask.</p><p>Figuring it was a good time for him to leave as well, he teleported himself and the Lantern Goat down to the ground where Aviana was frantically searching for her Iron Flask. After a few minutes of searching - while fighting off the Mountain Goat's attempts to trample her - she eventually found her Iron Flask and noticed that the brass stopper was firmly closed. Before she had time to wonder what was now inside the flask, the Mountain Goat's hoof stomped down and Aviana barely managed to turn around and catch it. The weight of the colossal creature made her sink into the ground but she didn't budge. Getting stomped to death by a giant goat was not how she planned to die!</p><p>The Lantern Goat Plex was riding - or rather was trying to ride as he had no way of controlling it - was about to run past Aviana and the Goblin figured this was a good an opportunity to leave as they were gonna get. He just needed a moment to cast a spell - and for that his mount would have to be still for even a second. He shouted at Aviana and the conversation that followed went something like this: </p><p>Plex: \"Hold the goat!\"</p><p>Aviana: \"I AM! CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?\" </p><p>Lantern Goat: \"Bleeee!\"</p><p>Mountain Goat ( *very annoyed*): \"**BLEEEEEEE**\"</p><p>Plex: \"Nooo, the other goat!\"</p><p>Aviana ( *also very annoyed*): \"LISTEN HERE YOU LITTLE SHIT...\"</p><p>Lantern Goat: \"Bleeee???\"</p><p>And so Aviana grabbed the Lantern Goat's horn as it ran past, now holding up the Mountain Goat's weight with just one hand. Plex used this moment to open a teleportation gate in the ground beneath them and he, Aviana, and the Lanter Goat all fell through. A few hundred feet away, at the other end of the gate, Aviana got launched several hundred feet into the air as the force of the Mountain Goat's hoof pushed her through. Her fall back down was slowed by several tree branches so she was barely falling anymore when she landed on the ground. Plex, pleased with his efforts to save himself, Aviana and, most importantly, the Lantern Goat, realised that the Mountain Goat was still coming for them. And that he would very much like Fearghas to see it...</p><p>When Plex felt Aviana's hand tighten around his neck like a vice once more, he felt the weave around him snap as her action caused a wild magic surge. The world around Plex twisted and he felt like his stomach was pulled through his nose - the oh so familiar feeling of unwilling planar teleportation.</p>"

          "content": "<h1>Summary - A strong neck can rule a nation</h1><p>Shalkoc flies away from the Duergar with Aviana in the iron flask. She is not happy about this, and when they meet up with us in the tunnel, she tries to strangle Plex, and both disappear to the Feywild. Again. We set up camp in the tunnel with the use of magic and grilled sausages.</p><p>We return to Ukgluz where many soldiers have been wounded in capturing the Leshen. Fearghas obtains an audience with King Dimzad, who is surprised to see him return alive, but more friendly than last time, and very forthcoming with (unwanted) advice on how to handle his slaves (that's us). There are some casual mentions of how to bind demons (shudder), and the \"demon engines\" the Duergar are using. This definitely is just an edgy name of no actual significance. Has to be. Right?</p><p>Fearghas requests a day of preparation before going to war with Matron Vandree. Dimzad agrees, and gifts to Fearghas a null-steel chain to better control his slaves. Fearghas invites us to his beautiful 7th-level mansion, and we have tea and investigate the null-steel chain. Emilio is particularly bothered by it. For Fearghas and I, it uncomfortably inhibits magic... and the chain's colour sends me into a panic as I suspect it's been made using the blood of angels.</p><p>Don't ask me how I know.</p><p>They ask me how I know.</p><p>Shalkoc assumes I have killed an angel.</p><p>Words fail me, surely this will have no consequences.</p><p>The party agrees to investigate the process of making the chains. We return to Ukgluz, ask around, learn that the chains are regular steel which are then treated in secret by priests, and no one is allowed in to see the process. Oh. No. Somewhere on the way, Shalkoc gets a ~~Discord ping~~ Message from Zariel checking in on his progress. Shalkoc replies that he has found an angel-slayer (HE MEANS ME) and Zariel orders him to present this person to her before the end of the week. Well this escalated quickly.</p><p>We can't figure out a way to spy on the priests yet, so we go to an apothecary for Shalkoc's needs of tasty herbs. We ask the apothecary if she has seen any unusual creatures, as Emilio insists the voidborn will return.</p><p>The Duergar just love to tell people how to handle their slaves. The apothecary scams us with foul-smelling \"mould\" (I'm convinced she chopped that off a rotting corpse somewhere) and mentions larvae larger than usual by a nearby lake. Fearghas freaks her out by saying he is an alchemist, and we walk to the lake.</p><p>Nature is twisted here, plants and larvae mutated, but Emilio doesn't sense the touch of the void. It reminds me too much of a certain demon and I grow increasingly anxious. Fearghas detects transmutation magic coming from inside the lake. We chug potions of water breathing, and jump in.</p><p>After a good half-hour of nerve-wracking swimming in darkness, and glimpsing tentacles among sharp pillars, we reach a brine pool and a fleshy wall pierced with long metal spikes. It looks like a huge, ancient creature being tortured. Reluctantly, I tell the party about the Sibriex lair I was in. I give them as much information as I can, including telepathic images of half-organic corridors and twisted creatures, but my courage fails me at the end.</p><p>We follow a current to a giant eye, also pierced with spikes. We can squeeze in... we don't talk very long before deciding to go in. The party is intrigued, but my conscience will not let me walk away. This thing is so close to a city full of people... slavers, yes, but people nonetheless.</p><p>Wait... the Duergar use \"demon engines\"? What if this big creature was *not* a giant tortured fish? What if the close proximity with Ukgluz is deliberate? I am filled with dread at the strong suspicion that we are... intruding into the lair of a Sibriex... that is *working with* the Duergar.</p>"

          "content": "<p>I meet the heroes at the gate. They are very kind to me, Aviana is a lot bigger than I expected! She nearly tramples some of the king's guards by mistake. Apparently this is temporary; Fearghas gave her a lot of non-soup potion?</p><p>The undead army threatening Lessia was scattered, so the king is preparing to throw a big party. There will probably not be any lemoncakes, but I still want to go.</p><p>Fearghas reports to the advisor to the king of Lessia (the king is nowhere to be seen) that the party delved into the mausoleum of Thamdarul to remove the undead general. The advisor nearly swallows his tongue at the news, and requests proof. He pulls a corpse from his bag of holding, as evidence. It's the corpse of Drakar Zul, the undead general and servant of the Lich.</p><p>The advisor fails to find words, asks Fearghas to put away the body, and goes to find the king. This is clearly far above his pay grade. A ring of dwarven guards surrounds the door the regent leaves through; they are very serious about their job.</p><p>The advisor, Mordram, returns with the king, who remains behind an honour guard of 30 dwarves. He thanks Fearghas for getting rid of the undead general, and announces the feast will also be dedicated to the party.</p><p>We leave the king's hall, and a giand Aviana waves at us. As if she was not TOWERING above everyone present. She proceeds to apologise for the rudeness. She has been speaking with the captain of the guard, Torgrus. He appears very tired, for some reason…</p><p>Shalkoc is ravenous, and Aviana goes on about her glasses. Fearghas is pleased by the outcome, somehow. Aviana thought I was a child, due to my very small size. I am offended. She is simply too tall!</p><p>As Mordram said quite clearly that Fearghas smells (he indeed does), Linzi recommends walking to a clear lake outside the gates to take a bath. Shalkoc is unwilling, and would rather kidnap a glassblower. Nobody wants to let Aviana stomp to the lake alone.</p><p>We all go to the lake. Shalkoc jumps into the cold water, Aviana opens a bottle, and Fearghas begins to scream. Shalkoc then gets out of the water, in a sense, and walks on it to the shore. Aviana says this is how he swims. Fearghas admits he doesn't know how the big lizard is doing it.</p><p>It turns out, Aviana freed an invisible Haunt and we are all flailing trying to catch it. I use my wand to cast Detect Magic, it does not help at all. We eventually have to give up and accept it flied away. Fearghas has a lot of words with Aviana, none of them friendly.</p><p>Shalkoc picks up a skeletal finger and begins to wave it around. I can sense necromantic energy in it; he casts False Life on himself and is very pleased with it. Linzi is happily taking notes, claiming this book will sell like crazy. I can see it. I can feel Fearghas' nerve weakening.</p><p>We walk back to Lessia and Fearghas explains about the giant rock floating in the sky. This is their island, Promise. I struggle to comprehend all of this…</p><p>The feast begins, and the king makes a speech. At this moment, a telepathic connection opens in my mind, and my boss, the Drow matron Vandree, tells me to explain why the undead army was routed, what is going on in Lessia, and what I've heard. I report with as much information as I am able, fearing for my life, my heart sinking into my socks as I am betraying Fearghas' home even as he sits right beside me. I ask whether the Drow will attack now, and before I can get a reply, the connection ends. I blink and come back to my senses, feeling sick. The king is nattering on about the people of Lessia and their courage, his gratitude to Fearghas… I am considering excusing myself, but I do not dare.</p><p>Fearghas whispers to me that the king is corrupted by a dragon's eye! The captain of the guard comes to Fearghas and whispers that a dwarf is here to see him and it is urgent. Fearghas gets up to leave, and I leap on the excuse to go with him, to leave the throne room. We meet with Barrik, who reports to Fearghas about the situation with the Duergar.</p><p>Lessia's mines are very close to Ukgluz, the Duergar setting I've come from… For years there has been an agreement between Lessia and the Duergar that they do not mine closer to one another. Recently however, orders have come from the king of Lessia to dig the other way. He MUST have known he would find the Duergar. Two or three weeks of digging found the Duergar, and the incident happened. We suppose the dragon eye is what caused the king to grow aggressive and seek to expand his territory.</p><p>As we discuss this, we hear a hollow roar coming from just above us! (I squeaked out of character, everything is fine.) A command rings out in everyone's minds; \"Give back what was stolen!\" We rush out to see a massive skeletal dragon carrying an undead man with a staff.</p><p>Fearghas and Aviana Windwalk to the gates, and Shalkoc sprouts a pair of wings, grabs me despite my screaming, and leaps into the air. 300 feet up above Lessia, I feel his grip slipping a little, and start apologising to my mummy and daddy. Somehow, he does not drop me.</p><p>We immediately start fighting the two undead figures. The dragon has a sickening bilious aura, and the Skull Lord teleports them both, it bites me because I am small (the audacity!), inflicting acid damage. We struggle, Shalkoc punches, the dragon starts destroying Fearghas. He is bleeding and within an inch of his life! Heedless of the risks, I rip my wards from my wrists and channel a heightened spell. I cast heal at 9th level, leaving Fearghas with barely a small cut.</p><p>Aviana tackles and dragon and drags it underwater, but it still beams its necrotic breath at us, Aviana dodges most of it but it hits me with full force. Fearghas shoots the Skull Lord several times with a Scorching Ray. Aviana is teaching the dragon to swim, for some reason.</p><p>We defeat the Skull Lord, and the Black Deathdragon, by shooting Shalkoc and having him deflect the missiles onto the dragon. Aviana emerges grumbling about poke-eyyyy-mons, and chucks the corpse of the dragon onto the shore so that Fearghas can start chopping it up.</p><p>Aviana carries the corpse of the dragon into Lessia, which is swarming with guards looking for Drow. The king's honour guard is blocking the entrance to the throne room. As we approach, the king leaps out and accuses Fearghas of being in league with the Drow, and having stolen the eye of Dahak! Not just that, but also to have lead the undead army against Lessia!</p><p>We tried to reason with the king. We tried everything. He is having none of it, and our only option was to be stripped naked and cast into prison to face \"justice\"… or resist. Fearghas put an end to the pointless argument, told his king he was ashamed of how low he had sunk, and teleported us all out of the throne room. We arrive in Locus on Promise.</p>"

Wait… me too? What about Linzi? We can't leave her behind!</p><p>As we materialise, there is a sound of metal falling, and Plex appears, trying to carry three full sets of plate armour, and failing. He takes a tumble and has a grumble about carrying all this. (Thank you Domi for the pipes falling sound, peak immersion.) Aviana offers ME Linzi's job, but I decline saying we must go back for my Halfling friend. Plex claims he traded the dead body that was inside one of the suits of plate armour while he was in the Feywild. Fearghas and Aviana are trying very hard to get him to say what he got in exchange for the body.</p><p>Plex traded the body of a dead dwarven hero for the freedom of his goblin friends Antrx and Prantx. He said it just in time to stop Fearghas from having a seizure. I'm not sure if I could heal that, definitely not with my wards on. Shudder…</p><p>We argue about the morality of eating and selling people. Could I heal myself if I had a seizure? I feel like I might find out, after hearing Shalkoc's arguments about selling organs. We also discuss what to do with the undead dragon's corpse, which Aviana is still lugging around like it's nothing.</p><p>Aviana contacts Linzi with a spell gem of Sending (\"the rock from the Hell Lady\"), and tells her to return to Promise. Linzi replies that she is hiding in the mines of Lessia with Barrik. Fearghas contacts Barrik with his own Sending spell, asking what is going on and whether Barrik needs picking up. Barrik replies that the king has started forcefully arresting people, and he fled with other people towards Ukgluz.</p><p>Fearghas turns into a cloud and skedaddles off to the mines of Lessia to teleport Barrik and his party to Promise. I slump on a couch inside the cabin, trying to recover from the whirlwind I have been swept into, when Aviana yells to me about dwarven smut stories, and Plex is looking for a sharp rock. Shalkoc is going up to his hoard to stow the dead undead dragon there. The dragon whom we sharply reminded of its own demise. Shalkoc wants it, for some reason. Aviana is looking for tools to make a tiara… for… me? Out of jade and dragon… bits? One of Shalkoc's scales? And a brick? She seems to struggle immensely, I somehow feel like Fearghas is here with us, shaking his head.</p><p>Aviana fumbles her crafting, and asks Shalkoc for further scales. I have a feverish image in my head of a harpy attemping to pluck a dragonborn like a chicken. In my defense, it is one in the morning, I have survived a battle and been teleported to a floating island, and feel I am starting to lose my wits.</p><p>I make some tea, and try to convince Plex to partake in a relaxing brew, but he sneaks off to town rambling about paint and gambling. He ignores my pleas about going to bed, and gets stopped at the gates by a guard who is convinced that our goblin is drunk. Plex attempts to explain that he lives in the forest, and much like Shalkoc earlier on the topic of selling people, or parts thereof, he only mires himself deeper. The guard leads him to the barracks to sleep off the assumed ale. Plex sneaks off, and wakes the entire town as he raises an alarm.</p><p>I give up looking for him and curl up on the couch to get some rest. I've slept much worse places. In the last week even. At least the couch is indoors, it's warm, and I assume the likelihood of being woken by slavers, or abyssal horrors, or why not both, is about as low as it's been ever since Edgar's shady friend dropped me off on the coast of Erastrea.</p><p>While I sleep, Shalkoc drapes a blanket over me without waking me, because he is very sneaky. How nice! But then Aviana goes to the town, growing huge again as Plex's Microscopic Proportions spell wears off. Predictably, she scares everyone out of their minds as she stomps around, a giant in the middle of the night. She claims it was just a test to get people accustomed to giants, as there is a trade agreement with, well, giants. She runs into Plex, who is still looking for paint. At this point I assume he means to fill his little lungs with the fumes, just for the funny feeling.</p><p>Even in my troubled dreams, I miss Fearghas' common sense.</p><p>Speaking of Fearghas, he is struggling to find Barrik and his party, having been to the mines very seldom. He is taking a long time finding his way, and has to cast Wind Walk again. As he does that, a wild magic surge hits him, teleporting him to the elemental plane of water. He drops into a deep, dark ocean with no prior warning. Does a cloud feel wet? This one certainly does, and grumbles healthily about wild magic.</p><p>I suddenly get upsetting dreams of Fearghas sinking in bubbling darkness. There is no way I am waking well-rested from all of this. He chuggs a potion of Water Breathing, casts Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion to escape the water (and sounds of whales and… ghost leviathans?? Aerelia I know you are going to read this, are you a Subnautica nerd? Great game, I cannot for the life of me play it. Not enough brown pants. Anyways. <em>- Haven't played it myself but I've watched multiple lets plays. Let's just say I'd find playing the game myself very boring because I wouldn't dare venture past the shallows…</em>), and then teleports back to Locus, from where he flies back, in cloud form, to the mines of Lessia to \"find those fuckers\".</p><p>\"I will pitch you like a baseball.\" - Aviana, 1497</p><p>And she does in fact, chuck the goblin and jumps away, landing in a massive explosion due to her cursed Thunderfeet Footwraps… Realising that jumping was a poor decision, she walks back to the cabin. She still cannot enter it due to being massive. She tries to cover herself with a dozen tiny (for her) blankets. I could probably wrap myself up in just one of these blankets like one Halfling maki roll.</p><p>Fearghas finally finds Barrik's party, they wonder why he is drenched but he clears it up with Prestidigitation. Even this much magic is terrifying to dwarves of Lessia, but Fearghas promises it's going to be all right, that magic is not scary. (I press X.) He works hard at convincing them that TELEPORTING is not scary magic. It takes one full hour, but props to ya, Fearghas. They all appear in Locus at dawn, and make their way to the cabin by morning.</p><p>I am woken by a completely exhausted Fearghas and many dwarves; he offers a room for me, and shuffles off to his own room to sleep. We meet up around three in the afternoon and go down to the living room to discuss what the hell we do.</p><p>I confess to the party that I am a spy for the Drow. Fearghas is angry, but he believes me and understands that I had no choice. I try to explain exactly how strong the Lady Vandree is, but I am no scholar, and can only relate what I've seen. Aviana suggests making friends, or fighting! Are they taking this seriously? When the matron comes for me on Friday, our lives will be on the line.</p><p>Fearghas proceeds to <s>google my boss</s> cast Legend Lore on the Matron of House Vandree. The spell only brings isolated words; exile, revenge, ambition. He then directs the spell to the Eye of Dahak; it is as expected an artifact of immense power.</p><p>We decide to go down to Ukgluz, and try to prepare for a confrontation with the Drow matron. Fearghas gives me a spellgem of Nondetection to shield myself from the matron's scrying spells (I assume that is what she is using to find me), and he places in his breast pocket one spellgem of Revivify, and a diamond that can be used to cast Raise Dead, in case one of us dies. Sadly he does not have a black sapphire, so I remain unable to summon my Umbral Spirit.</p><p>Aviana is considering which spirit to be blessed by, Fearghas is muttering about spells and gems, Plex suggests casting Death Ward on me. We are trying to figure out how to find the matron. I give as much information on the Drow as I can; the matron doesn't usually participate in combat, her three consorts are also powerful spellcasters, and the fighters are the backstabbing kind, or the shooting from afar kind. They are not keen on taking risks, as they aren't versed in healing magic.</p><p>Shalkoc flies off to find an ally of the party's, a spidery Drow lady called Kali, with very unsettling eyes. Fearghas casts Comprehend Languages because Kali speaks Druidic. We learn that House Vandree was led by twins… so my boss, the one who does NOT have the scar on her left eye, has a twin sister. One of the sisters was pronounced dead some years ago, but rumour has it that she was still alive. That is probably my boss. Kali giggles and says \"You have no idea who you are dealing with, do you?\", and tells us that House Vandree specialises in assassinations, and that their contracts are very expensive.</p><p>Plex wants to use me as bait, to draw the Drow party out and beat them up. I do not think that's a good idea.</p><p>The longer the conversation with Kali goes, the more concerned I get… House Vandree has immense power, and even an exiled matron is more powerful than I can imagine. I suspect that trying to fight her will get us all killed, or worse. Kali suggests we go to the Abyss and hire a DEMON to help us. (IRL my heart went cold at that.) Aviana tries to give to Kali a pristine white dress of an angel, bought in Hell. Kali is not terribly keen, considering the lack of pockets. I'm just sitting here white as a sheet at the talk of demons and angels. Eventually the memories haunting me are too much, and I am violently sick.</p><p>Fearghas decides to Wind Walk to Ukgluz and try to find my boss. However, we first stop at Fearghas' parents' shop to pick up supplies for a potion of heroism. Sneakily. As we hover over the shop in cloud form, we see one of the king's honour guards exit and walk away. The shop is closed and dark, but Fearghas' parents are nowhere to be seen. The house bears no signs of struggle, like the couple simply left. In the shop, many of the alchemical tools, and most of the ingredients and potions are missing. Fearghas collects the few remaining ingredients.</p><p>We head to Ukgluz, take a break for Fearghas to brew us potions of heroism, as Shalkoc whips up some rice balls to snack on. Plex casts Death Ward on me. Feeling as prepared as we'll ever be, we float above Ukgluz. It looks a lot more impressive from above, despite extensive destruction from boulders falling from the ceiling. Now… our campaign against the exiled matron of House Vandree begins.</p>"

          "content": "<p>As we camp outside of Ukgluz and Shalkoc wraps up rice balls, Fearghas contacts his father with spellgems of Sending. As he opens his bag, the thing blurts out \"You're the loveliest hag in the coven.\" His father is alright, though imprisoned, and Fearghas tells him he is trying to find a solution. Family love.</p><p>Plex and Aviana argue, grapple with each other, and both disappear. Fearghas sighs heavily, \"we do not have time for that\". Indeed we do not, but Plex teleporting another person is a new thing. Fearghas asks about my wards, I do my best to give an explanation, but leave out exactly how crippled I am without them. It's not a matter of trust, really… call it an expression of hope. We exchange quick information about our respective abilities. I cast Augury to consult the omens on our looking for the Matron, the results come up mixed; weal and woe. Well that is ominous.</p><p>We float down to Ukgluz in cloud form. It's an industrial place, all rough black stone. Soot from furnaces thicken the air. The city teems with slaves supervised by Duergar. There are many statues… The city looks very different from above. The walls are heavily guarded by more Duergar with glaives. (something about chaos dwarves and a war hammer, but none of us is using such a heavy weapon, how very odd!)</p><p>We float to the hospital, where I am known and hope to find some help, then we make for the morgue to transform out of cloud form without being seen. Fearghas and me are sneaky, but Shalkoc stumbles. In cloud form. How he manages that is beyond me. A Duergar accidentally inhales a whisp of Shalkoc and coughs. I am a horrified little cloud. The Duergar definitely notices a strange cloud, and alerts others. Shalkoc does his very best cloud impression, it seems to convince them as they laugh and walk away.</p><p>The coast is now clear, so we /uncloud in the morgue. There are three bodies covered in shrouds, and not much else. Shalkoc wants to disguise himself as a doctor. I say we should probably leave before somebody finds us living people in the morgue, and that the dead won't tell us much. Shalkoc disagrees and uses his little finger (well, Dam'ghur's little finger, which is now Shalkoc's, so Shalkoc's Little Finger Formerly of Dam'ghur's) to cast Speak with Dead (and that's a surge). Fearghas establishes a telepathic bond between the three of us.</p><p>Shalkoc begins to question the three dead bodies.</p><p>S: How are you today?</p><p>Dead: Cold.</p><p>S: Huh must be very cold being dead then?</p><p>Dead: Yes.</p><p>Shalkoc is enlightened by this and concludes that it must not be very nice to be dead. Fearghas sighs even as Shalkoc continues with the question \"Why are you dead?\". They reply in turn \"work accident\", \"defending Ukgluz\", and \"throat slit by a knife-ear\".</p><p>Fearghas tries to get Shalkoc to ask better questions, especially from the assassination victim.</p><p>S: Where?</p><p>Dead: The shrine of Azgal.</p><p>S: How to get there?</p><p>Dead: Walk.</p><p>And that's his five questions from the assassination victim. Fearghas makes sure nobody is coming our way. I say I worked with Thorkam Burnbleeder and we could look for him. Shalkoc further enquires from the other dead about the way to the shrine, and gets somewhat usable directions.</p><p>Fearghas makes Shalkoc and himself invisible so they can follow me undetected as I look for Thorkam. A guard approaches me, limping down the hallway with his glaive. He asks me where I come from, I reply I returned in a hurry because I need to speak to the Matron. Something with the guard seems… off. He is hiding something. I try to pry, but do not want to behave suspiciously and let him be on his way.</p><p>Shalkoc tries to grab the Duergar, losing his invisibility in the process. (8 strength but he rolls a nat 20, you can't make this sh*t up). The guard screams. Fearghas screams too, in our heads: RUN! Shalkoc sprouts his wings and flies off.</p><p><em>The mental image of Shalkoc flying into a random room, and ending up face to face with a MAD old Duergar lady threatening him with a hairbrush yelling SAAAAAAATANA. No this is not personal experience, ha ha.</em></p><p>None of the above happens in game, our Dragonborn escapes and Fearghas pretends very hard to be a potted plant, unseen, unheard. The Duergar attempt to arrest me for \"collaborating with the knife-ears\". I think to Fearghas: NOW we run. He breaks invisibility, and casts Dimension Door to teleport us to the roof of the hospital. Shalkoc is hiding in the morgue. Fearghas calls him to fly up to the roof, he lands saying \"WHEW that was scary!\". Both of us proceed to tell him off, and we then turn back to cloud form and hover towards the altar (the shrine of Azgal).</p><p>Fearghas picks up some of the words the Duergar are speaking; something about a scepter being stolen. We hover as clouds and brainstorm. It is not going well. Fearghas does some cloud shenanigans, casts Comprehend Languages, and eavesdrops on the priests at the shrine. It turns out that Dimzad, the king of Ukgluz, is furious that the scepter has been stolen, and in the name of all Duergar, he has declared war on House Vandree. Dimzad has sworn to execute all of House Vandree, especially after an unsuccessful attempt at dialogue, and an emissary now missing a tongue.</p><p>We decide to seek an audience with Dimzad, which may be a terrible idea, but it's better than blindly scouring the Underdark looking for the Matron. My very important job is to keep Shalkoc from doing anything stupid as Fearghas walks up to the very surprised king's guards and claims (in Common) to have information about the stolen Scepter of Azgal. He asks to speak to the king.</p><p>Fearghas is allowed to come in, under heavy guard, arms over his head at all times. If he makes the smallest misstep, he will be killed on the spot. Can clouds sweat? This small cloud is sweating so much, it might be raining. The darker cloud that is Shalkoc next to me seems to be sniffing the air in hopes of food smells, but all we pick up is ash, soot, and sulfur. If a cloud could wrestle another cloud, I would. I just frantically think at him to stay next to me.</p><p>Dimzad is one massive Duergar, who is intrigued that Fearghas is not an emissary, and working against the king of Lessia. He demands to know how Fearghas knows that Matron Vandree stole an artifact. Fearghas is struggling to explain himself, being very careful with his words. He claims he heard rumours, and reveals that the \"Matron Vandree\" the Duergar are hunting is the exiled twin sister who is my boss. The king grumbles about surface dwellers not knowing honour; an oath must be kept no matter what.</p><p>Dimzad asks Fearghas what he has to offer. Fearghas replies \"a Halfling who was enslaved by the Drow\". I think \"haha, yeah\" at that, and Fearghas mentally lifts an eyebrow at me. The king wants to imprison me in the deepest dungeon, and is surprised when Fearghas refuses, and says I am under his protection. The king does not want to let me run free (supposedly I am too useful), but Fearghas, bless his heart, insists that I should be free. Dimzad wants to put me in chains, use me as bait, fire on the Matron (and me) when she comes, and if I live, enslave me to work in the hospital again. Fearghas says it's too obvious a trap and it won't work because of my magic, and Dimzad casually says he can put me in antimagic chains. I start to scream in panic, in Fearghas' head (and Shalkoc's).</p><p>The king asks what artifact was stolen from Lessia. Fearghas honestly replies \"it's the eye of a dragon\". The entire room GASPS (even the walls I am sure; they tend to have ears so why not a mouth too, really). Dimzad is <em>very</em> interested. He asks Fearghas <em>why</em> he wants the eye of Dahak. Fearghas says he wants to inspect it in the hope to cure a curse. Dimzad is way too interested in the eye (and in the Halfling, that is me, supposedly the head doctor at the hospital spoke highly of me). All of the Duergar are deeply confused as to the simple <em>notion</em> of letting a healer run free…</p><p>The king does not believe that Fearghas and his group could deal with the Matron. (I don't blame him honestly.) For us to prove our strength, he tasks us with removing (he says the word \"close\") a nearby hindrance… a portal to the void. If we can manage this, Dimzad will help us. (Shalkoc is trying to puzzle out how that \"help\" will fit into his dragon hoard.) Fearghas agrees to deal with the portal in exchange for the Duergar's help to deal with the Matron.</p><p>We discuss the void portal. Fearghas assumes it connects to the Far Realm, and reveals that Plex:</p><ul><li><p>\"acquired\" a Demilich</p></li><li><p>found a void portal and started to communicate with it</p></li><li><p>was requested to make a sacrifice to the portal, and chucked the Demilich into it</p></li><li><p>asked for a friend in return for giving up the Demilich</p></li><li><p>was promised a friend, but the party closed the portal</p></li></ul><p>I have no words.</p><p>Fearghas wants to go fish Aviana out of the Feywild so that we can go deal with the void portal. I suggest scouting and researching first, because picking up our harpy from the Feywild is going to take a lot of magic. The portal is VERY close by, just an hour's walk from Ukgluz. We float there as fart clouds to investigate. As we travel, Fearghas and Shalkoc fill me in on how they are BOTH contracted to devils of Hell.</p><p>Fearghas assures me that I do not have to help him, or Shalkoc, fulfil their contracts. But I saved Fearghas' life, and I may be a strong healer, but I am not strong enough to watch a man I've healed, who has helped me, dive into deadly danger. I also admit my other reason to stick with him; if we are fighting demons, I am IN.</p><p>We arrive to an encampment of Duergar that are keeping watch on the void portal. We has proof that King Dimzad sent us here; a hat he gave to Fearghas, similar to the hat the king is wearing, but much smaller. We /uncloud at the bottom of stairs, to the sound of very heavy boulders being rolled. Fearghas reluctantly puts the hat on. There are ballistas around the camp, pointing at the… stairs? As we approach, the Duergar turn around, look at us, and Fearghas casts Compregend Languages. The Duergar say in Deep Speech \"The unbelievers have come for us!\". In the distance, heavy steps approach…</p><p>We roll initiative. The camp is also full of large, rolling stone creatures (granite juggernauts). I spring into action first, and try to restrain the nearest one with Binding Shadows, but they resist my magic. The eyes on these things are burning, but also blacker than night, a darkness so deep it seems to shine. (I snap at Aerelia at this, of course.) My spell has failed, and I very bravely hide behind Shalkoc, who rushes to the thing and punches it very hard. Shalkoc tanks like a boss with Turtle style, but also punches the juggernaut some more, for good measure. The juggernaut charges Fearghas, but our dwarf is too tough for the monster, stopping its charge. (bonk)</p><p>One of the ballistas shoots at me, but I am too smol! As Fearghas is distracted by the stone construct strangely… nuzzling… him, an iron golem stomps up the stairs and comes to nuzzle Fearghas on his other side. He is deeply uncomfortable. I get shot by another ballista, successfully (and painfully) this time. A chain is attached to the bold and it drags me across the floor as I (bravely) yell \"eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelp\". The same happens to Fearghas, with considerably less squeaking.</p><p>The next ballista shoots an explosive bolt at us, Fearghas has sick dodges and I am just out of range (phew). Fearghas summons a spiritual weapon to hit one of the juggernauts; the wheels slip out from under it and it crashes to the floor. It would be very funny if the iron golem wasn't looking at me like I'm kindling in the middle of winter… I free myself from the ballista bolt and try to run, but it has higher reach than I thought and slices me on the way out. I quickly heal myself but it only begins to knit my wounds.</p><p>Shalkoc bravely turtles to the golem and <s>spits</s> breathes on it. It does not work out great. One of the Duergar went invisible at some point so eeeeh… we don't know where he is. Shalkoc gets a major surge that makes all our potions useless. The golem punches him hard, then turns around and slices me with his sword (natural 20 aaaaaaa). It hurts a lot, and I am badly injured. Shalkoc punches half-heartedly, making very little progress. Fearghas gets harpooned again. The Duergar are running around repairing the ballistas. One of the Duergar tries to run, falls down, and breaks his neck. Less work for us…?</p><p>The bag of scolding savagely roasts Fearghas. He slaps a Curse of Biting Cold on the iron golem; Fearghas makes sure to shout to Shalkoc about the effects of that curse. He then shoots all of five scorching rays at the closest juggernaut (pew pew). He teleports himself out of the ballista bind like a boss, and bravely takes cover behind a pillar.</p><p>I'm hurting, bleeding, and afraid… I intended for a healing spell on myself, but for a moment the shadows guide my hand, and I direct them to the golem and the closest juggernauts for a Shadow Monsters spell. It works! I take cover behind the golem, cast a healing word, and then watch in awe as Shalkoc punches the hell out of the golem… with his fire gauntles… which would normally heal it. I crouch (bravely of course) behind the golem, and the next ballista shot misses me.</p><p>Fearghas magically and bravely shoots at everything. Go Fearghas! The juggernaut I hit with Shadow Monsters just rolls over the iron golem, absolutely flattening it. I frantically heal myself, popping sorcery points like candy. I want to take cover but I got hit and grappled by the braglista (the bragging ballista that insists I am a tiny fairy) so there is no way to wriggle free just now. Shalkoc goes to <s>spit</s> breathe COLD on the juggernaut and the very flattened iron golem. He also punches really hard again. What a lizard!</p><p>Meanwhile I am still getting repeatedly shot like I'm a plump little duck. Through multiple severe piercing wounds, I grit my teeth and hold on to my concentration with all my might. Fearghas tells me to get closer, that they shoot at the farthest target. Fearghas shoots at things once more, and tries to be the target for the bolts. I'm bleeding heavily; in barely controlled panic, I stumble to Shalkoc, free myself from the grappling bolt, and remove my wards to heal myself. It drains me, but the pain begins to fade.</p><p>Shalkoc rushes in, but as a deep stab wound opens on his body, a Duergar with a glaive appears next to him, invisibility spell shattered. My wards are on the floor and my body feels slow… I need to get to Shalkoc! The golem spews poison at Shalkoc, who appears completely unaffected (all the same, I squeak a little bit). Fearghas begins to rapid fire at the ballistas once more, getting frustrated at how poorly they burn (despite being made of wood). <em>Aerelia is a little sheepy because he gave them lots of HP.</em></p><p>Shalkoc is barely standing in the middle of enemies. I take out my onyx dog figurine and throw it to the floor, yelling the command word AMBULANCE! Dwen the Rock appears, I hop on his back and we run towards Shalkoc. My spellwards all but forgotten, I reach out to apply a <em>juicy</em> Healing Word on him (7th level). It takes a heavy toll, but Dwen steadies me.</p><p>The Duergar hits Shalkoc, and he is enlightened by this. \"Nah,\" our Dragonborn says with a dominating smile, \"let me show you how it's done.\" He can now crack a whip as well as Jill. Who's Jill? Don't worry about it. He takes an attack like a champ to punch back; the Duergar does not get back up. Fearghas is hanging out at the back, protected by a Shield pierced by dozens of ballista bolts. He tries again to cast Fire Bolt, fails again as his armour hampers him. He is fiercely grumbling.</p><p>I move in, still riding Dwen, and fire (haha) a Cone of Cold from my staff, and heal myself… almost to full… because my max HP has been lowered so much. Shalkoc continues punching, invigorated by my healing. Fearghas grits his teeth as he dashes and loads up a Ray of Frost that finally goes through, and deals a number on the golem, but it still stands. He commands his spectral axe to slash at the golem, getting it square in the chest. A black sapphire tumbles out! I limp to pick it up.</p><p>We made it… Shalkoc and me are injured and I'm shaking from the channeling fatigue, but Fearghas is mostly grumbling with GREAT conviction due to his armour's arcane failure rate.</p>"

          "name": "72 - A rainbow goat and other abominations",
          "section": "journal-pages",
          "content": "<p>Just as the fight ends, Plex and Aviana appear in a flash of light. Plex is riding a screaming goat surrounded by rainbow light. We start trying to figure out what is happening, when a man walks up to us, telling us to be quiet. His hair is white and his eyes are purple, very unusual colours for a human… He gives the name Emilio and tells us to shut up the goat one way of another. Fearghas is trying to make ANY sense of the situation, with very little success. Shalkoc slaps the goat, Plex ties a piece of yarn around the goat's neck and casts a spell, which stops the goat dead in its tracks, hanging from the now-immovable yarn. Plex flies off the goat's back, pulls a backflip in mid-air, and makes a perfect landing in front of the goat. He is standing halfway into the tent, through the tent really. A surge made him able to pass through walls.</p><p>I very tiredly ride Dwen in search of my spellwards, which I let fall during the battle. Emilio says the portal is extremely dangerous and needs to be closed right now before anything (more) steps out of it. We try to discuss the goat, and what to do with it, which is very difficult to do over the goat's screaming. Aviana argues that the goat is a political agent in treating with the Feywild, and that it MUST survive. Fearghas and Emilio ask that we please leave the goat behind. Plex is feeding scraps of tent canvas to the rainbow goat, which is trying to strangle itself on the immovable yarn. There is talk of another goat inside the iron flask.</p><p>We decide to rest for a moment before taking care of the portal of impending doom. Fearghas explains to Aviana and Plex what happened while they were in the Feywild. Shalkoc cooks a re-hydrate streak for himself, a burger for Fearghas, an eyeball-looking cake (??) for Aviana, and a recovery dumpling for me. Our harpy lady tries to give Emilio a cute nickname. He is not keen.</p><p>Fearghas asks for clarification about what happened in the Feywild. Aviana \"explains\":</p><ul><li><p>Plex made friends with goat people</p></li><li><p>People in the Feywild get extremely drunk</p></li><li><p>Aviana lifted a big rock, there was a goat underneath</p></li><li><p>The rock goat was scary, it stepped on Aviana, Plex used a gate to launch Aviana into the air</p></li><li><p>The Fey people gave Plex and Aviana the rainbow goat as a sign of thanks</p></li><li><p>The rock goat is still in the Feywild, and is very angry and Aviana and Plex</p></li><li><p>Plex teleported into the forest and found a lantern goat (our rainbow screaming goat)</p></li><li><p>Plex claims the rainbow goat is a party-saver and his friend</p></li></ul><p>Shalkoc wants to cook the goat, predictably.</p><p>Emilio is extremely overwhelmed by all this noise we're making. I try to soothe him, offering a cup of tea, or a chance to pet Dwen. Then Aviana tries to put the rainbow goat in chains. Plex and Aviana try to convince Fearghas to teleport the goat to Promise. He refuses, also predictably. Aviana begins to apply nail polish.</p><p>The goat stays behind.</p><p>Then Emilio says time is up, and we need to go. We go towards the portal, chugging various potions on the way. The air grows thick with purple mist as we approach. Translucent chains connect to the portal, on either side of a chasm filled with purple smoke. A scream sounds in all our minds; the others recognise the Void Dragon. Misshapen creatures pour out of the portal, along with a wave of void energy. Acid washes over us, Fearghas and I brace for it just in time, but the others get hit full force. Thankfully (?) I have experience taking acid to the face (maybe Fearghas too?). Plex looks at one of the monsters; it trips over its own claws and dies. One down! That was easy.</p><p>I step forward, riding my dog into battle. Brandishing my staff, I throw a fireball at the creatures, frying two on the spot (Chokers). Looking at the anchor for one of the chains, I see it is covered in runes. It is sturdy, but if it is hit JUST right, it will shatter. Emilio investigates the chains, after muttering that the runes are in Deep Speech. The chains are tangible enough to be held… therefore probably pulled… therefore probably yanked out of the portal. Emilio just… points, and blasts the insect-like creature (Wardu) three times, with incredible force (haha).</p><p>The big spiky creature (Otyugh) speaks to us in our minds… it projects images of an enormous purplish dragon covered in eyes. Plex then teleports himself to the portal with an Arcane Gate to get a good look. He does not get a good look. He still peers into the portal, and he does not understand what he sees. He's left feeling confused, afraid, and incredibly small and insignificant. Our goblin decides to step back and hide. We can clearly see his efforts.</p><p>Shalkoc accidentally steps through Plex' Arcane Gate, looks at the portal up close, and turns to the side real fast-like. He boosts himself with a scale, then <s>spits</s> breathes on the Otyugh. Aviana chugs a potion and becomes massive again. Possibly because her eyes are so big now, she can see the anchor a lot better, and concludes that they can be <em>disabled</em> instead of destroyed. She yells at Plex to turn off the magic thing. Fearghas steps through the Arcane Gate. He gets a <em>really</em> good look at the portal, and theorises he can <strong>overload</strong> that, which could damage it, and possibly destroy it if he were to throw enough magic juice at it. He can't rule out an explosion, but he says we will call that \"plan Bee\". I don't see any bees around here…</p><p>Emilio argues that portals are unstable by nature, and slapping more magic into it probably isn't a good idea. Fearghas then further investigates the anchor, looking for a way to disable it. He puzzles out the Deep Speech, and disconnects one of the chains from the portal. The portal… calls… for help. Plex' portal does not answer (we checked). More little shites come through. I knew it wouldn't be that easy…</p><p>The portal unleashes another wave of acid. Emilio is hit hard, and Dwen whimpers and reverts to his figurine form. A lot more creatures step through the portal, and last of them, an ominous, staff-bearing abomination scuttles out. That's another fireball. It fries up all the little things, but the scuttling thing (Warped Seer) dodges it. I try and fail to disable the anchor. Emilio tries too, but he is short on the brain juice. He fires at the Wardu but only one beam hits.</p><p>The Otyugh crawls up to Aviana, clearly impressed by her muscles. Chomp! But Aviana dodges the bite. She slaps the Otyugh's tentacles away. The aberration sends images to her mind of… rule 34?! Which confuses Shalkoc, our sweet summer Dragonborn. We move on. The Warped Seer scuttles over to Shalkoc and whacks him <strong>very</strong> hard with his stick. Shalkoc is severely injured and knocked prone… then the Seer hits him again. He goes down and does not get up again. The Seer then walks away and melts into the ground.</p><p>The flying tick (Wardu) looks at Emilio crosswise, then stabs me. Twice. Emilio is deafened by the Wardu's stare. Plex teleports Shalkoc closer to me. He's still not moving, and a wave of acid is coming up… Contrary to Aviana's belief, he CANNOT \"take it\". Aviana rages and stampedes into the Wardu, which is knocked back and pretty much lands on Emilio. She proceeds to do it again. She then grabs one of the chains (it feels slimy) and yanks it out of the portal. Fearghas walks up to another anchor but he is pushed back, returns to it grumbling, and gets pushed back again. His grumbling intensifies. He smothers it with an extra large potion of healing, just before a new wave of acid rolls out. More enemies appear, including a translucent, purple, humanoid… <em>thing</em>.</p><p>Shalkoc, if we survive this, you BETTER bake me some honey cakes. I take off my wards and summon what little strength I have left. Nobody is prepared for the burst of healing I unleash on Shalkoc; he springs to his feet, back in top shape. Emilio fires his lasers at the Wardu and it pops like a disgusting blood balloon. He tries to disable the anchor and fails, but suffers no bad consequences. Things are slapping Aviana. Things are slapping Fearghas. The Seer scuttles through the portal to Emilio and me. Plex! Help us! Any bright ideas are welcome!</p><p>Plex <s>rescues</s> teleports me across the chasm, and makes the Seer smell like <s>feeeeesh</s> fish. He tries very hard to shove the Seer off the edge with telekinesis, sadly the scuttling bastard resists it. Plex tries to disable the anchor, but fails and is pushed back. He immediately runs back to stand right in front of the Seer. Shalkoc punches the Seer, but he uses his reaction to swap positions with another voidborn… THE BIG PURPLE FUCKER. Shalkoc is unimpressed and punches on, stunning the hulking aberration. He continues to punch! With conviction! So much conviction! But then he tries to yank the chain out, causing it to reverberate. The disturbed chain radiates necrotic energy, hurting us all.</p><p>Aviana walks past one of the Otyughs, it bites at her leg, but she is unflinching! She casually continues to walk, dragging the aberration with her, teeth still clamped on her leg. She strides toward the Seer, ignoring minions. She grabs a Wardu and holds it in front of the portal. The Wardu gives her a judgemental glare. She is unfazed. Fearghas tries once more to disable his anchor. This time it's a success! Three more Otyughs crawl out of the portal. Fearghas conjures up one massive hand, then teleports closer to me with a Misty Step.</p><p>The portal expels another acid wave, but Aviana blocks it alone, protecting us all. She stands right in front of the gate… and she can just make out the shape of the void dragon rushing towards us. I heal Plex, then myself, and I try to disable the anchor, but fail. I take psychic damage and get knocked back. Emilio blasts the Star Spawn Hulk (the purple fucker), and also attempts to disable the anchor, but no luck.</p><p>Aviana has a lot of \"friends\" over there. They're scared of her. I would be, too. Shalkoc punches the Wardu with a Leaden fist; somehow it does not die on the spot. Then he runs off to help Aviana, who very much needs it. Aviana disregards the portal, and rushes to help us instead. Things slap at her on the way, to little effect, until one of them does… radiant damage?! That hurts. She juiced up on a potion of speed, so she reaches us, still holding the Wardu. She reaches into her pack and… throws a bedsheet… \"full of Plex stuff\" (wooden chicken statues)… across the chasm. The statues come to life and all peck at the anchor with their tiny knife beaks. They destroy the anchor, and a bunch of scuttling Seers appear, along with four Hulks.</p><p>Aviana squishes the Wardu for good luck, but it drips disgusting fluids all over her painted nails. With a warning for Plex, she yanks the chain out of the portal… but a force pulls it back. Something beyond the portal is holding the other end of the chain… She says she needs both hands and chucks me the Wardu. As she pulls the chain harder, claws and a snout appear through the portal, hanging on to the chain and trying to drag it back. She is doing a tug-of-war with the void dragon. She asks Emilio for advice. He says we're too late, that the dragon is coming through either way.</p><p>Detaching the chain from the anchor might be our only hope… Aviana hits the anchor, destroying it. The chain fades, and Aviana stumbles then catches herself just in time, very short of crashing into me. (That might have killed me, too.) The portal closes! But the voidborn remain…</p><p>The Wardu Aviana squeezes looks at Plex… menacingly. He's worried about his chickens. Aviana asks Emilio to pick up Plex' chickens. Shalkoc gets <s>yoinked</s> teleported into the middle of the voidborn. One of the Seers fires an orb onto one of the Hulks… it is healed, and reverberates the damage to everyone around it… Fearghas commands his Bigby's Hand into the fray and make it grab Shalkoc with the intention to chuck him towards us. We are trying to get the hell out of here. I use my last sorcery point on a twinned Guiding Bolt, bursting one of the Wardus. Emilio is trying to pick up Plex' chickens while Fearghas is yelling at him to leave the chickens.</p><p>Emilio… teleports? across the chasm. With a tiny void portal. The party's trust for him plummets. Plex already laments the loss of his chickens. I argue that he can't have chickens if he is dead. He is unconvinced. Shalkoc kindly casts Cure Wounds on me. It's weak sauce but I appreciate the gesture. Shalkoc tries (and fails) to pop the last Wardu. He goes into Turtle Stance <em>just to be safe</em>. I appreciate this gesture even more because I no longer have the strength to scrape him off the floor. Aviana gives the Wardu a good squeeze, sadly still not enough to pop it. She then jumps over the chasm to go get the chicken statues… The shockwave from her Thunderfeet shatters seven of the chickens. Plex might be about to cry.</p><p>One of the Seers is catching up to us and blasts Plex with three Psychic Orbs. In reaction he activates his Abjurer's Bangle, absorbing most of the damage. Another Seer fires at Plex; he crumples to the ground. The next Seer shoots, this time at me. It hits hard, but I keep my footing. I need to help Plex! Fearghas makes an Arcane Gate to the other side of the chasm, and says we are leaving. Plex… I rush to his side and heal him, and hesitate before running through the gate. Plex, Shalkoc, and Emilio are still on the other side…</p><p>Out of nowhere, tentacles burst out of the chasm, grab one of the Hulks, and drag it down into the purple smoke. An unfortunate event… for him, not for us. Emilio attacks, then runs into the gate. Plex casts Thunder Step, teleporting him and Shalkoc across the chasm. Aviana opens the iron flask, releasing a horned humanoid (it's a Leshen, we all recognise it). Aviana speaks friendly words in Sylvan. The Leshen turns into a flock of crows and comes for us. It casts a Wall of Thorns, Fearghas promptly pops a Counterspell gem… it does not work out. Emilio casts Counterspell. To everyone's relief, it works. The Leshen casts Grasping Vine, which lashes out at Emilio. He is pulled towards the vine.</p><p>Emilio is hit by three Psychic Orbs, and goes down. The Leshen hits me, triggering Plex' Death Ward. Fearghas apologises to Shalkoc, as he is out of range of his teleporting spell. \"Meet us back in the mines of Lessia.\" Shalkoc and Aviana are fast enough to run and meet up with us. They will have to be. We appear in the tunnel overlooking Ukgluz. Fearghas hands me a healing potion, and feeds another one to the unconscious Emilio. Plex is still mute, but he tries his best to communicate.</p><p>We sit in the dark tunnel nursing our wounds, waiting for Aviana and Shalkoc… and hoping.</p>"

          "content": "<h1>A rainbow goat and other abominations</h1><p>Plex, Aviana, and a screaming rainbow goat appear. A man with white hair and purple eyes tells us to be quiet, that includes the goat. We try several things to shut up the goat, including a piece of immovable yarn, with very little success.</p><p>We take a short rest, eat some food, and discuss:</p><ul><li><p>the goat's political importance in the Feywild</p></li><li><p>the void portal of impending doom</p></li><li><p>another goat, angry, and in the Feywild</p></li><li><p>goat people (I'm sure this will not come up again)</p></li></ul><p>We leave the goat behind and go to the cavern where the portal is. The ground is split in two by a smoky purple chasm. The portal is held open by five chains, anchored on either side of the chasm. The void dragon screams in our minds (that's rude) and the portal spits acid at us (no manners!).</p><p>There are some void critters, Plex kills one just by existing. I start to grill the rest of them, with great efficiency! I don't like this... it's too easy. Aviana seems to agree, she drinks a potion and becomes very big again. We figure out various ways to close the portal, including one that seems very unwise (overloading the portal with a lot of magic).</p><p>More monsters appear, these ones are intelligent and one of them beats Shalkoc senseless. Emilio is shooting beams, Aviana is charging, and Fearghas is <s>grumbling</s> trying to disable the anchors. I heal Shalkoc with such force that he springs to his feet without a scratch on him. (My upstairs neighbour has kindly been made aware of this.) Plex makes one of the Seers smell like fish. Aviana blocks an acid wave from the portal, holding a Wardu for emotional support (the Wardu's, not her own).</p><p>The more anchors we disable, the more monsters appear. Aviana throws Plex' chickens at them, then she plays tug-of-war with the void dragon, and nearly yanks it out of the portal! Emilio is pessimistic about the outcome, I don't blame him. Turns out he has void powers too. The plot thickens. There are a lot of Seers now and they are killing us real fast-like. We manage to close the portal, but there are now way too many abominations for us to handle. Fearghas says we are leaving, he makes a gate to take us across the chasm so we can run back to the cavern we came from. Plex is struck down by the Seers. I scrape him off the floor.</p><p>We eventually all get across the chasm, but Aviana has the bright idea to <em>once more</em> open the iron flask. An Ancient Leshen springs out and proceeds to beat us the hell up. Fearghas uses a spellgem to teleport us out of here, but he can't catch Shalkoc and Aviana into the range, so we tell them to meet us in the tunnel overlooking Ukgluz. We teleport there, all severely injured and Emilio unconscious. Fearghas feeds him a healing potion, and gives me one so I can feed it to myself (not in this order).</p><p>Now we just hope our friends can find us again.</p>"

          "content": "<p>Aviana and Shalkoc escape arrest by the Duergar by… Shalkoc flying up, with Aviana inside the iron flask. They leave the Duergar to deal with the Leshen, and Shalkoc flies up to the tunnel where we had been huddling for about three hours. We've had a short rest, and Plex is no longer mute. Shalkoc releases Aviana from the flask; she is grimacing with a terrible headache, and is in a vile mood. After a few words from Plex, she again grabs his neck, and both of them disappear. Fearghas attempts to explain the process to Emilio, he does not seem very enlightened.</p><p>Shalkoc is very out of breath from flying all this way, so Fearghas casts Leomund's Tiny Hut as a ritual, conjures up Unseen Servants, and we set up camp in the tunnel. The bag of scolding grills Fearghas, we take a long rest. Shalkoc cooks up an impressive amount of bacon, egg, and sausage, helping everyone feel alive again.</p><p>We discuss our plans, the voidborn, and whether Shalkoc could conceivably feed all the void invaders to appease them (not likely). Motivated by Fearghas' enthusiam (and reluctance to burn a 6th level spell slot first thing in the… evening? We slept the day away), we walk down to Ukgluz. Many of the statues in Ukgluz are severely damaged, scratch marks like those left by giant claws. The hospital seems to be overflowing with wounded soldiers, most of them with broken bones like they've taken a big fall. Some look like they've been bitten by a swarm of mosquitoes. I ask the party if they know what kind of creature could do that. Fearghas says a spell could do that; Insect Plague.</p><p>We assume all these wounds occurred in the Duergars' attempt to capture the Leshen. :')</p><p>Fearghas asks for an audience with King Dimzad regarding the void portal. We are ushered in by excited guards who did not expect we would survive. We are all impressed by the strength of the neck on King Dimzad, supporting the massive hat on his head. He greets Fearghas, surprised and pleased to see him, congratulates him on the… use of his slaves (that's us). The Leshen apparently destroyed several of the Duergars' demon engines; they eventually caught it, but it's proving troublesome, \"like a demon but not quite\". Shudder…</p><p>Fearghas explains that the Leshen comes from the Feywild, but that he doesn't really know any more about it. Dimzad wants to get his hands on Aviana (alive or dead) to try to bind the Leshen. He does not seem to understand that Fearghas can't just sell him Aviana. Dimzad claims that the more emotional a demon gets, the easier it becomes to bind it. I'll keep that in mind… The king is pretty convinced that the Leshen is a demon and not a fey creature.</p><p>Fearghas reminds Dimzad that there was an agreement for assistance in fighting the Matron Vandree, but the king tries to backtrack and say that closing the portal only proved that Fearghas is \"worth serving him\". Fearghas guesses that Dimzad is just saving face in front of his court and not actually trying to short us. Phew… Dimzad and Fearghas proceed to have a very uncomfortable conversation over my head about training your slaves, and keeping me from escaping. The king suggests a chain of null-steel, and promises to gift one to Fearghas.</p><p>On the way out, Fearghas mutters that he hates Duergar. Shalkoc replies that we should deal with them once we are done with the Drow. I am shaking at the thought of anti-magic shackles. Emilio is brooding. One of the king's servants comes to us carrying a very heavy chain that looks like it's covered in soot, despite being clean. Fearghas receives advice to \"bind the Halfling with that\". He examines the chain with great interest. I am definitely uneasy. Fearghas? We are friends yes? We're at least allies?</p><p>Fearghas casts Detect Magic on the chain; it is non-magical. He knows that it inhibits magic, but does not understand exactly how, yet. Fearghas leads us into an alley out of sight, and casts Mordenkainen's Magnificient Mansion. It is an impressive dwarven mansion, with a cohort of servants that look like clockwork constructs resembling dwarves. Fearghas formally welcomes us in, and Shalkoc makes a beeline for the larder that is bursting with ingredients. Emilio and I are confused as to how anyone can casually cast a spell of such proportions. He's not wearing spellwards! Let alone taking them off!</p><p>One of the rooms is a \"hall of grudges\". A dwarven thing, Fearghas says. Don't worry about it. There are three categories in the hall, alphabetically ordered: A, G, and P. I wonder what is written in there… We start discussing magic and its various origins. Emilio says his magic was forced upon him, he is not comfortable with explaining. Fearghas says that wild magic surges did not always happen, that they appeared a long time ago, from the Feywild \"bleeding\" into the material plane. He also says that infusing spells into gems can bypass the wildness of magic.</p><p>Fearghas is still curious about the null-steel chains, and asks Emilio to bind his wrists with the chain. On the point of touching the chain, Emilio recoils and takes a few steps back. I offer assistance, but Emilio declines. Fearghas asks Shalkoc to bind him instead. It's a cold burn on his skin, and he grows tired and unfocused. He is not comfortable. Shalkoc winds the chain around his wrists, and does not seem to mind the cold touch.</p><p>I agree to have the chain put on me… for science. It's a little bit like my spellwards, just a million times more intense. Familiar, if uncomfortable. As I examine the chain I realise… the one dark spot on one of my bracelets is the exact same colour as the chain. I freeze, mind racing. Shalkoc and Fearghas kindly ask if I'm okay, but I start stammering that I need to know HOW these chains are made. I can't stop myself from shaking and praying that my suspicions aren't true. Concerned, Fearghas suggests that we look into it right now. I agree, trying very hard to keep my emotions together and mostly failing. We go back to Ukgluz in a hurry to figure this out.</p><p>We go to the market looking for a smithy. Looks like the Duergar eat a lot of fish from the many many lakes in the Underdark. A Duergar comes up to Fearghas wanting to buy Emilio. Fearghas politely declines. Emilio looks even more grumpy than usual, especially as the Duergar insists… Fearghas asks how the null-steel chains are made. The Duergar says they are regular steel chains, that are brought up to the priests in the temple, and the chains come out soot black and much stronger. I do not like where this is going…</p><p>Fearghas casts <s>Discord call</s> Rary's Telepathic Bond so we can communicate discreetely. I am questioned about my suspicions regarding the null-steel chains, and I reluctantly admit that I suspect the Duergar are using the blood of angels. I show my stained spellward to support my claim. Fearghas is intrigued, and Shalkoc assumes I have killed an angel. I can't find any words in response to that… Emilio wants to ask around about more voidborn, or another void portal. A frightening perspective. I wish our big and strong harpy was with us.</p><p>Shalkoc suddenly… claims that \"we are working on it\". Zariel just contacted him and asked how they are doing. He winks at me. I am so confused. He shares Zariel's messages with us, demanding to know Shalkoc's progress on their contract, and details. Shalkoc claims he met someone who kills angels. He means me. Now Zariel wants to meet this \"angel-slayer\" within a week. It's not a question, it's an order.</p><p>At the party's prompting, I confess that I killed an angel. I was trying to help, I did not mean to. Emilio tries to cheer me up, with little success. Fearghas says that we can't blame ourselves for circumstances outside of our control. If only their words could make the nightmares end… I clutch my staff to remind myself that even a stained soul can be forgiven. It will not make the nightmares end. Shalkoc just takes it in stride that I am an angel-slayer, and we can keep Zariel waiting before sending me to Hell to meet her.</p><p>We go browse herbs for Shalkoc who is looking for seasoning. Fearghas grimaces as we walk into a shop (something about \"a bunch of snake oil\"). The shopkeeper is doubtful about letting slaves in, but Fearghas insists. The lady shows us a very dubious brown mould… which I'm sure is some kind of body part… very much not fresh… She offers to let Fearghas sniff it. Shalkoc is enthusiastic and speaks up about wanting to smell it. Out loud. The shopkeeper is SHOOKETH at the lack of control Fearghas has over his slave… She then opens the glass right under Fearghas' nose. He downplays the absolute reek of the stuff with all the dwarven sturdiness he can muster.</p><p>I recognise glowworm root, that wriggles and glows in contact with air. It's edible and nutritious, if not pleasant. There is also a fungus called barrelstalk… drinkable, as they store a lot of water, but they taste like very stale, very mushroomy flavour. On Emilio's behalf, Fearghas asks the shopkeeper if she has seen any unusual creatures when she was out gathering plants. She claims some larva-like creatures near a nearby lake have been unusually large. Fearghas enquires about the deeprot (the brown mould) and its uses. He buys a portion for 15 gold, and she saws off a piece of the growth, scrapes up the mould, and hands it to our alchemist. She claims it's great for freeing up clogged sinuses. I am doubtful.</p><p>Fearghas mentions he is an alchemist and the shopkeeper begins to stammer. She was scamming us was she not… She says she has to close down the shop now. The apothecary very nervously closes down her shop. She did mention that the miners use the deeprot, and also the priests. We walk to the lake some miles away. It's relatively peaceful, for the Underdark. The water is very still, and on the shores grow bioluminescent lichen. As we walk up to the nearby shore, we smell something disgusting. The plants on the shore look mutated, leaves growing out of other leaves like cancerous growth.</p><p>We find the larvae mentioned by the apothecary. They are massive, and also mutated, growing into one another in a chaotic and twisted manner. Fearghas says there is something \"fucked up\" here for sure. Emilio doesn't sense anything void-y. Shalkoc argues that the larvae must be full of protein. Fearghas absolutely vetoes the idea and investigates, finding a faint trace of transmutation magic in the mutated things. It seems to be coming from under the lake. Fearghas hands out potions of water breathing. I can't swim, so Fearghas says \"take my hand\". We all drink our potions and jump into pitch-black water.</p><p>We lose all sense of up or down in the absolute darkness. Emilio seems to be able to see… just fine? For the rest of us, the colours are gone, so he updates us on the fish's weird colours. The fish are looking at us weirdly, some with all three of their eyes. We swim deeper down, pressure building on my ears the only indication that we are farther from the surface. In the distance, a bright light flickers. Fearghas is guiding us towards the source of the transmutation magic he sensed. We can't really gauge direction or distance from the light source. Is it moving? We can't tell…</p><p>We approach carefully, all too aware of the tactics of anglerfish. Emilio spots first the tips of multiple spikes, unevenly spaced, rising from below us. He says they look like quills, like they are part of something bigger. As we come closer, it's a full forest of them, about half a metre in diameter, growing to a very sharp point. D-do they look like needle-sharp teeth…? The light source we saw from afar is actually a tiny fish swimming in a circle, with a luminous growth on its head.</p><p>We give the glowing fish a wide berth, and swim on downwards. Emilio glimpses something moving in between the big spikes. I finally remember to use magic to enhance my vision. Out of the corner of my eye, I spot the end of a tentacle between the spikes, retreating out of sight. I stammer \"k-k-krakeeen!!\" in the telepathic bond, which seems to amuse Fearghas and Shalkoc. We spot a flat white surface below us; as we grow deeper, we see it's a brine pool. We swim closer to it but stop short of it, oh goddess I hope we survive this.</p><p>We spot more spikes, these looking more metallic and a bit rusty. These spikes are not attached to, but sticking through a surface… around the spikes is scar tissue… very old scar tissue, wounds that have healed and re-opened over and over again for years. I imagine this wall of scars in front of us is an ancient creature, and a very large creature that has been suffering for longer than I can imagine. We pick a direction at random and follow the wall, hoping to find a head or a tail. Fearghas swims down into the brine pool, promising to go back up immediately.</p><p>He swims back up a good 30 feet away from where he dove. There is a current in there. We follow the direction of the current with the idea that one person dives into the brine pool now and again, tied to a rope so we don't lose them. We figure out the rough shape of an immense flattened blobfish. At the edge of the brine pool, the skin of the creature becomes flat and glassy, a giant eye mostly immerged in the brine pool. The eye is so huge we cannot see it all. Multiple spikes are piercing the eye… we can see into it, the needles pierce all the way through. The outside wounds have closed, but on the inside, the wounds are a lot worse. We could squeeze along that spike into the body of that thing… there seems to be light inside.</p><p>I tell the party about what I think is torturing the creature. Sibriex. I show them my memories of an angel endlessly tortured. Clinging to sanity, I tell them that this is my problem, that I cannot let this demon live. We decide to go into the creature and attempt to end its suffering. As we are about to go in, the giant fish begins to shake as if in pain… This creature is alive, and it's being tortured. As it moves, the spikes tears bigger wounds in the tissue surrounding them. Shalkoc is leading, and squeezes through the opening with a squelching sound, and he disappears from sight.</p><p>A chilling thought occurs to me then. What if it was not a creature being tortured? Not a fish pierced by spikes but something that was never an animal in the first place. What if this was a space shaped by a demon? A Sibriex' lair.</p>"

She is not happy about this, and when they meet up with us in the tunnel, she tries to strangle Plex, and both disappear to the Feywild. Again. We set up camp in the tunnel with the use of magic and grilled sausages.</p><p>We return to Ukgluz where many soldiers have been wounded in capturing the Leshen. Fearghas obtains an audience with King Dimzad, who is surprised to see him return alive, but more friendly than last time, and very forthcoming with (unwanted) advice on how to handle his slaves (that's us). There are some casual mentions of how to bind demons (shudder), and the \"demon engines\" the Duergar are using. This definitely is just an edgy name of no actual significance. Has to be. Right?</p><p>Fearghas requests a day of preparation before going to war with Matron Vandree. Dimzad agrees, and gifts to Fearghas a null-steel chain to better control his slaves. Fearghas invites us to his beautiful 7th-level mansion, and we have tea and investigate the null-steel chain. Emilio is particularly bothered by it. For Fearghas and I, it uncomfortably inhibits magic... and the chain's colour sends me into a panic as I suspect it's been made using the blood of angels.</p><p>Don't ask me how I know.</p><p>They ask me how I know.</p><p>Shalkoc assumes I have killed an angel.</p><p>Words fail me, surely this will have no consequences.</p><p>The party agrees to investigate the process of making the chains. We return to Ukgluz, ask around, learn that the chains are regular steel which are then treated in secret by priests, and no one is allowed in to see the process. Oh. No. Somewhere on the way, Shalkoc gets a ~~Discord ping~~ Message from Zariel checking in on his progress. Shalkoc replies that he has found an angel-slayer (HE MEANS ME) and Zariel orders him to present this person to her before the end of the week. Well this escalated quickly.</p><p>We can't figure out a way to spy on the priests yet, so we go to an apothecary for Shalkoc's needs of tasty herbs. We ask the apothecary if she has seen any unusual creatures, as Emilio insists the voidborn will return.</p><p>The Duergar just love to tell people how to handle their slaves. The apothecary scams us with foul-smelling \"mould\" (I'm convinced she chopped that off a rotting corpse somewhere) and mentions larvae larger than usual by a nearby lake. Fearghas freaks her out by saying he is an alchemist, and we walk to the lake.</p><p>Nature is twisted here, plants and larvae mutated, but Emilio doesn't sense the touch of the void. It reminds me too much of a certain demon and I grow increasingly anxious. Fearghas detects transmutation magic coming from inside the lake. We chug potions of water breathing, and jump in.</p><p>After a good half-hour of nerve-wracking swimming in darkness, and glimpsing tentacles among sharp pillars, we reach a brine pool and a fleshy wall pierced with long metal spikes. It looks like a huge, ancient creature being tortured. Reluctantly, I tell the party about the Sibriex lair I was in. I give them as much information as I can, including telepathic images of half-organic corridors and twisted creatures, but my courage fails me at the end.</p><p>We follow a current to a giant eye, also pierced with spikes. We can squeeze in... we don't talk very long before deciding to go in. The party is intrigued, but my conscience will not let me walk away. This thing is so close to a city full of people... slavers, yes, but people nonetheless.</p><p>Wait... the Duergar use \"demon engines\"? What if this big creature was *not* a giant tortured fish? What if the close proximity with Ukgluz is deliberate? I am filled with dread at the strong suspicion that we are... intruding into the lair of a Sibriex... that is *working with* the Duergar.</p>"

Shalkoc sticks his head through the opening at the base of the spike, and signals that the inside is dry. We follow him in. Aviana asks about the goat, arguing that it was going to be a sacrifice. Fearghas rolls his eyes, and promptly roasts the goat with a Fire Bolt; \"we don't have time for <em>another</em> goat.\" He pushes me through the opening; I collide into Shalkoc who smelled the roasted goat and wonders what is cooking.</p><p>We eventually all slip through the opening, in the residual smell of soggy goat curry. The tunnel we are in is damp, uncomfortably warm, walls glistening and pulsating. It smells like a constitution save… we hold our noses in disgust, but Plex and Emilio don't look so good. We hear an androgynous, gentle and caring voice in our minds telling us: <em>I felt your arrival, like soft whispers in the æther. Fear not the crossing; you are safe now within this hallowed realm.</em> Emilio is very angry at this. Something about enough voices in his head…? I tell the party to not trust it, that the demon is trying to get us to let our guard down. Fearghas agrees, and hands me a vial of silvery powder… He does not say what it is, only urges me to consume it as he hands a similar one to Emilio.</p><p>Aviana explains that Plex acquired a goat hat, and the curry goat that Fearghas murdered. She also says that she and Plex could not save the kittens in the Feywild from the red caps, and that we have to return there to save the kittens. Fearghas hands the null-steel chain to Aviana, who goes on a tirade about king and why we should all settle for bondage instead. Plex pulls out his thinking cap, a Headband of Intellect in the shape of a goat. Aviana grabs the headband with the plan to reforge it into thinking glasses.</p><p>Fearghas asks me whether the Sibriex has mental powers. I say yes, though I can't be entirely certain. He uses a spellgem of Mind Blank on Aviana. Plex no longer detects her with Detect Thoughts. She is no longer a thinking creature as far as his spell is concerned… He then recasts Rary's Telepathic Bond to include Aviana and Plex into the connection. Plex casts Fey Step, ignoring Fearghas' warning against teleporting in here… He takes a step up… and thinks to us that there are enemies next to him. We can't see or hear him. I summon my Umbral Spirit, Fade, and tell her to find the goblin. I also heal Emilio to cure the poisoning incurred when he stepped into the lair.</p><p>Aviana steps up to me and says proudly \"Look! I can do magic too!\" She says some gibberish words, then casts Death Ward on me! Fearghas is incredibly proud. Plex is being attacked by humanoid creatures that… look like they used to be people. Some bits swapped, a messed up jaw, and psionic shullbit. Fearghas considers breaking through a wall to get to Plex, then evaluates the thickness of the wall, and reconsiders. He sees something up ahead, and is in turn seen by it too. It's a swarm of maggots, and something invisible. I miss my mum and dad…</p><p>Shalkoc runs past Fearghas into the left branch of the tunnel. He sneezes on the swarm of maggots, like only a Dragonborn can, burning them all like popcorn. Delicious… Something lashes back at him, and he is stunned. Fade runs down the tunnel, attracting unwanted attention. She does not find Plex, and blends into the shadows, turning invisible. Plex casts Ashardalon's Stride to unleash fire on the maggots, but a wild magic surge turns him tiny. He picks up popped, not burnt, maggots.</p><p>Aviana congratulates Emilio on being the most sensible, least aggressive member of this party. Plex glimpses an honest-to-gods ABOMINATION, bloated with a second head that is nothing but a gaping maw. I very frighteningly sidle close but not too close to a big lump of wall-flesh… Bits of it seems to be chewing… I don't want to know on what… I inhale the silvery powder Fearghas gave me, trying all the while to look everywhere at once. Aviana chugs a potion of growth and becomes big again.</p><p>Fade is hit by a psychic ray from a Walleye, but the charm has no effect. Plex is getting attacked by something bitey but he's so small he <strong>dodges</strong>… once. On the second bite, he is <strong>swallowed</strong> by the Bloater. Plex uses his gift of the Gem Dragon to push it back, inflicting minor damage. He is still inside the thing, swimming in stomach acid. Fade runs back to where I was to report, as I don't share her senses… but I do feel what Plex is feeling and it's not fun. </p><p>Plex blasts the Bloater from the inside with his magic, hard enough to be spit out. Emilio buffs himself somewhat uselessly, but who knows what the future may bring? He joins Shalkoc by a pile of dead maggots. The Bloater dashes towards Aviana, this waddling thing as big as Aviana. It's aptly named… it's so full of fluid, the skin is tight and it makes sloshing sounds. Disgusted, I focus my magic at it and fire a Guiding Bolt! It hits real hard, and I leave Aviana to deal with it as I join Shalkoc, Emilio, and Fearghas. The latter is grumbling at something and flailing with his axe. A wild magic surge makes him explode-y.</p><p>Aviana is highly disgusted by the Bloater and dreads getting vomit on her new dress. She enters rage and slashes at the Bloater with her talons, tearing it open. Fluids spill all over her. She is deeply disgusted. I don't blame her. Plex is considering the benefits of being eaten again, even though he is already in a rough shape after the first time he was snacked on. He is bitten by the second Bloater, swallowed again, and uses a MYTHIC FEATURE to convince himSELF that he is not blinded in there. I'm screaming in the telepathic bond because I feel his wounds, and he will die if he is exposed to the stomach acid again. He beholds the wonders of the inside of the Bloater's stomach with eyes open. If we did not need the telepathic bond for a petty thing like SURVIVAL, I would nope out.</p><p>Fearghas enquires on the state of the Bloater. Aviana says it's probably almost dead; I squeak that it is still very much moving despite leaking fluids everywhere. Fearghas sends a barrage of Magic Missiles towards it. This is how he figures out that there are two of them; because Plex is broadcasting the inside of a Bloater through the telepathic link, and no impacts happen. Shalkoc is punching another monster (the one with a very altered jaw; Obscuroth). As he kills it, Shalkoc hears a voice in his mind again. Almost motherly, it says: <em>I sense your confusion, and it is alright. Many souls arrive still carrying the shadows of conflict. But that creature… it was just another soul, like you, perhaps a little lost in its own way. Let us try a gentler path to understanding. </em>When he shares the message into the telepathic bond, I feel sick… and increasingly angry.</p><p>Fade runs towards the slashed Bloater and leaps out of the shadows to bite it, before fading into the darkness once more. Plex barely survives being digested by using his Abjurer's Bangle. He throws an immovable spear into the Bloater's stomach, then gets out by using Fey Step. Emilio blasts maggots and another invisible Obscuroth. He then also hears something in his mind and shares it to us: <em>Please, children, there is no need for such harshness in this place of healing. Let understanding be your weapon, not violence. </em>Healing?! I'm going to MURDER this thing! Emilio blasts the Obscuroth all the harder; it responds with a Psionic Rebuke, but Emilio saves.</p><p>I slap a Chill Touch on the Bloater, but it's not enough to kill it. I back off just before Aviana slashes it again; it collapses and explodes in a burst of acid. Aviana goes down the right-hand tunnel and finds… a cloud of magical darkness. She decides to CHARGE INTO IT. She hits a flesh wall, and attacks the darkness. A Walleye spots her, and fires a Psychic Ray at her. She resists the charming, and continues into the darkness. Plex is calling out in the telepathic bond… none of us knows where he is. I'm sticking with my friends and letting Fade scout.</p><p>One of the Obscuroths attacks Emilio, breaking invisibility. He reacts with a Hellish Rebuke, frying it where it stands. Shalkoc… catches… a Psychic Ray… and tries to slap a Bloater, to no avail. He dashes, slaps again, but his hand only meets a wall with a disappointing wet sound. Fade takes some acid damage, shakes herself to get rid of the acid, and runs up almost to Aviana. There is a Walleye there, it casts Darkness, nobody can see Aviana anymore. There is also an Obscuroth there, but Aviana scares the wits out of it. That's how we figure out it still had wits of a sort. Knowing that does not help in the slightest, because it indicates that there is maybe a person enduring in the monsters…</p><p>Plex casts Maelstrom, trapping Shalkoc in it while the Bloater escapes the spell almost unscathed… The Dragonborn exclaims \"What the hell? I'm coming to save you!\" I call out to Plex and try to find him, but in my haste I run right into the line of sight of a Walleye… The Psychic Ray hurts, but I resist the charm. I asked Emilio to stay close to me, he confirms he will follow. Aviana shouts out to me, but she is not in the telepathic bond and I'm too far to hear. She swaps her Spirit Beast's Blessing to Tiger. She pokes a Walleye, then grabs it. She jabs her thumbnail into the eye, making it lose concentration. The darkness disappears but Aviana still can't see a thing.</p><p>Another Psychic Ray shoots out of the wall; I ignore the pain, barely keeping concentration, and resist the charm with all my might. Fearghas tries to find Aviana; why did we split up agaaaaaain?! He blasts an Obscuroth with a Ray of Frost, then laughs at it magically. \"You've got a face like a burst kebab!\" He says, dealing psychic damage. Shalkoc takes damage from Plex' Maelstrom. We take care of one another in this party… Shalkoc delivers a bonk on the Bloater with enough force to stun it, then punches it a lot more for good measure.</p><p>Fearghas points out an enemy for Fade. She crits her bite, but doesn't manage to kill it, and fades (haha) into the shadows again. The invisible monster hits her hard in response; she is very close to dissolving into darkness. Plex drinks one repulsive potion to heal himself (it's snot), then casts Sapping Sting on the Bloater. I step right up to the edge of the Maelstrom and throw my +2 dagger at the Bloater. It hits! The monster still stands, barely. Aviana squeezes the Walleye she is grappling, piercing it with her talons. It's still not dead, so she jumps in place, causing one massive blast from her Thunderfeet Footwraps. It hits her too, and she yanks the eyeball out of the wall.</p><p>Fearghas once more laughs at the invisible Obscuroth, which barely fails to kill it. \"Naami, your cat's got this,\" he says and walks away. He finds Aviana, who chucks him the eye she ripped from the wall. Shalkoc is still unable to escape Plex' spell. This is getting embarrassing… Shalkoc goes into the centre of the Maelstrom to punch the Bloater to death. It explodes, but Shalkoc dodges the acid blast. Turns out, Fade hasn't got this. Her bite misses, and the Obscuroth kills her. My poor Fade dissolves into dark mist.</p><p>Emilio launches three blasts against the Walleye that'd been hitting me every turn, but it reflects one of them onto me. It hurts… but I can finally see Plex! Heedless of the cost, I extend a hand towards him… the magic takes my blood to fuel a healing spell. I don't care. Plex' wounds are healed, and a voice speaks in my head: <em>Such selfless acts are the very essence of Nirvana. You bring joy to this tranquil place with your innate kindness. You understand already</em>. I am livid… but suspicion begins to sneak in. Is this the demon speaking, or is it something worse?</p><p>Aviana runs past me, and attracts the attention of the Walleye. Emilio asks me for permission, but he won't say what for. I yell at him that this is not a time to keep secrets. Fearghas backs me up, but Emilio refuses to speak. I'm very upset with everyone except Fearghas. Emilio is hit by the Walleye, and reacts with a Hellish Rebuke. Aviana hears something come towards us… something huge, stomping with meaty sounds. Emilio stammers that it's bigger than Aviana. The monster (Major Malleable) grabs her; she calls Shalkoc to come help. Plex casts a spell of Detect Thoughts to try to locate the enemy, but the range is too short. Plex is eating the maggots again… he convulses, and collapses, unconscious. Uncontrolled terror blinds me for a second, my mind flooded in memories and overwhelming dread. Do I even dare healing him? What if…</p><p>Emilio blasts the Major. I run to Plex and examine him… he is afflicted by a form of madness that will last 8 minutes. A spell of Calm Emotions or Lesser Restorations can cure this! Just as I figure this out, a spellgem begins to glow in Plex' pocket, reanimating him. I yell at him as Aviana dares him to eat another maggot. I heal some of my own wounds, but my magic feels weak, my hands are shaking. I don't think using healing magic on Plex would have harmed him… but the dread that overwhelmed my mind for a moment is not entirely gone. It will get worse. I need to get a grip.</p><p>Aviana flexes and makes her cloak billow. Only Emilio sees this because of the magical darkness. She grabs the Major and drags it out of the darkness. She jumps with it, landing in a blast of thunder. That monster is not only huge… it's amorphous, with organs that don't belong in their places… I've seen the like before… I have seen… I see Aviana's wounds, and all my fear returns in a rush as the Major attacks her and grapples her. Half of her wounds would kill me.</p><p>Fearghas chugs a Potion of Maximum Power, and casts Scorching Ray. Three powerful rays of flame hit the Major. Shalkoc repeatedly punches the Major, and realises it is completely immune to acid damage. Plex casts a level 7 Tether Essence on Shalkoc and Aviana. They willingly fail the save, letting the spell take effect. Emilio pummels the Major with three blasts, exploding in purple clouds. The misshapen creature collapses and dies.</p><p>Finally, the chaos ends… for now. Fearghas begins to cast Leomund's Tiny Hut as a ritual… and the voice speaks up in our heads again: <em>Yes, pause and breathe in the tranquility, dear ones. The transition from the River to the boundless peace of Nirvana can be… intense. Rest is a balm, and I am here to offer comfort and guidance. </em>Fearghas grumbles that this demon is weird. Aviana casts Find Traps and says that the walls are traps, the floor is a trap, the ceiling is a trap… everything around us is a trap of confusion, disorientation, madness, acid, suffocation, poison, infestation with maggots, exhaustion, blindness, and losing the ability to escape.</p><p>Aviana requests Plex to bite her. I draw my dagger and threaten her with it, telling her to sit still and let me heal her. The voice tells us: <em>Please, try to be calm. Such reactions are echoes from the world you left behind. Here, in Nirvana, all spirits are to be cherished and guided with kindness.</em> I snarl at it to shut up. Shalkoc casts Cure Wounds on Aviana, which pleases the voice. Plex bites Aviana. Fearghas starts violently scolding Aviana and Plex, with good reason.</p><p>We attempt a short rest, and heal up. Fearghas pulls out his void explorer spellbook. Emilio glares at it for a second; his hands twitch and he struggles for a moment, then transforms into his Void Form. The white of his eyes go black and the bandages on his hands burst open, revealing wicked claws. Eldritch energies spark around his claws. Plex freaks out and pushes Emilio away and out of the bubble with his telekinesis, knocking him prone in the bargain. We question him, but he growls that this is his real form, and there are more important matters to take care of.</p><p>As Emilio is thrown out of the hut, he sees that the hallway behind us… looks nothing like it used to. Shalkoc begins to cook an eyeball cake for Aviana, with very little concern. Our wizards figure out that teleportation and planar travel do not work here. We're trapped.</p><p>As we settle down to rest, the voice speaks again: <em>Rest now, little spirits, you've just navigated the currents of the River of Souls. It's not uncommon to feel a little bewildered upon arrival. All is well here.</em> I am convinced now that this is not the demon speaking, but a celestial from Nirvana. While we sit and rest, the magical darkness moves towards us. The celestial (?) speaks about the light of dawn as the darkness is coming closer.</p>"

          "name": "75 - There are TOO MANY fluids!!",
          "section": "journal-pages",
          "content": "<p>Fearghas crushes a gem of Mind Blank and smears the dust on my forehead. I am excluded from the telepathic bond, but immune to psychic damage, charmed, mind reading, and scrying spells. Shalkoc makes me a batch of… meat… cookies? Lacking in crunch, they are surprisingly tasty. I try to not wonder too much where the meat comes from. Plex pulls out a stash of Silver Tears and requests something in exchange for them, which makes Fearghas grumble. After trading with our goblin for cocaine, Fearghas casts Foresight on Shalkoc to give him the power of the Echo and advantage on pretty much everything. I give Aviana a root to eat and recover 21 HP. She claims I am the only one who cares about healing her, which is not only false but mildly pisses off Shalkoc (understandably).</p><p>Clouds of magical darkness drift past us. We're already completely lost in the maze of shifting corridors… We eventually gather our courage and leave the bubble. As we walked along a narrow hallway, then walked back, we found a wall. Then another wall as we turned around. The ground started to open up, a puddle of blood forming, sizzling like acid. Emilio and Fearghas start to feel unwell. The hallway in front of us opens up and the walls around us twist and shake with growing intensity. A cloud of darkness comes towards us! Just in time, Emilio warns us of a creature in the darkness, then says the wall blinked, removing one of the Walleyes.</p><p>Emilio goes ahead and describes a lake of blood to us in the darkness, and a big creature ahead. There is a snake-like creature in the pool, along with body parts and, below the surface, items like in a waste pool. We wonder if there is a stomach up ahead, I interject that this is not a real creature we are in. Emilio fires his three blasts into the darkness, and hits another Major Malleable. A snake made of guts slithers from the blood pool and up the wall. The Slithering Bowel (eat dirt, Aerelia) sprays digestive fluids at Emilio, he dodges most of it.</p><p>Aviana walks up to Emilio; the tunnels are barely wide enough for her. She casts Resistance on herself, then takes out the dented iron flask and holds it at the ready. One of the eyes on the wall glares at Emilio with such intensity that he is charmed. I heal him of his poison, then apply Piercing the Veil. Emilio turns to me and says that now he is not the only one cursed with knowledge. Shalkoc tries to blindly punch the Slithering Bowel, but misses, punches a hole into the wall that immediately closes itself. Another of those abominations spits a tooth at Shalkoc, who deflects it onto the other bowel. It spits another spray of digestive fluid at us. I am so disgusted I dodge it close to perfectly, but Plex on my shoulder is not so lucky and gets a whole drop on him.</p><p>Plex and Emilio are blinded by the acid. Emilio is hit by more acid, and dazed. Fearghas mumbles at the back, and then casts a Lightning Bolt, under my direction. His spell only grazes us harmlessly, but it hits two bowels and the Obscuroth from last time that we didn't chase. It was just chilling invisible at 1 HP. F in the chat. It appears as its corpse drops on the shore of the blood lake. Shalkoc is grabbed by something exceedingly fleshy and dragged into the acid pool. He managed \"elp\" before he got attacked by a Major Malleable.</p><p>The walls are spasming violently, tripping Emilio who was already blinded, charmed, and dazed. From the ground, he shoots three blasts at… Fearghas? They all miss, and Emilio shakes himself from his daze. He breaks free from the Walleye's charm too, but he is still lying prone. One of the slithering bowels spits acid at us, blinding Emilio and Plex all over again. Aviana works herself into a rage and steps into the darkness and grabs a bowel, at Emilio's urging to tear it apart (he is very sick of being blinded). She can't see through the darkness, and steps into the blood pool. She struggles out and climbs up on the wall, still squeezing the bowel, shouting to Shalkoc all the while.</p><p>Shalkoc gets hit by the Walleyes' psychic ray, but deflects it. He still gets charmed. I start towards Emilio to heal him, but as I do so, a wild magic surge surrounds me in magical darkness. I'm distracted and my spell comes out weak; the spasming walls trip me and I stumble next to the warlock. Plex falls off my shoulder squeaking. I grit my teeth and channel a Healing Word on Emilio, doing some actual healing this time, but ANOTHER wild magic surge makes me allergic to cloth. I am wearing cloth. My eyes are just streaming at my own dress, and the channelling fatigue hits hard.</p><p>Not my day.</p><p>Plex dodges the meat folds in the ground, and climbs back up on my shoulder. He casts, blindly, Ice Storm. Aviana dodges it, but the terrain is all slippery now. Shalkoc is charmed by the Walleye, but uses Stillness of Mind to remove it. And that's another surge, the next dog he sees in in fact, god. Anagrams, y'all. He is still being grappled by the Major Malleable in the acidic blood pool; as Fearghas puts it, \"gently caressed by the meatball\".</p><p>Fearghas is tripped by the spasming walls, jumps to his feet, and uses a spellgem of Dispel Magic to clear up the magical darkness around me. It's a big relief… although my dress still itches and makes my eyes water. Grappled by the malleable, Shalkoc is being drained of his spirit so hard that even his max HP would be reduced, but he uses a mythic power to resist it. Another cloud of magical darkness erupts from the Major Malleable, from the same wild magic surge I got a minute ago. Emilio is still prone but gets up at last. He is pissed off and goes into Void Form of his own accord. He stumbles into the icy area left by Plex, and fires Eldritch Blast on the Slithering Bowel. The latter wriggles free from Aviana's grapple and slithers away. Aviana smacks her talon down on it and crushes it before it can escape.</p><p>She calls out to Shalkoc, leaving one cloud of magical darkness and stepping into another one. Shalkoc calls for help, he is being grappled. She grabs the Major Malleable that is holding Shalkoc, and drags it, then jumps while holding it. \"Shalkoc, do not resist,\" she says, as Shalkoc is dragged along, through the air, and takes heavy damage from the Cursed Thunderfeet when Aviana lands. The Walleye sees Aviana get too close, and becomes very uncomfortable. It casts Darkness.</p><p>I channel my summoning spell and call a powerful form of Fade to help in the battle. Emilio describes to Plex where the enemies are as he loads up a Gravity Fissure. Plex is no longer blinded, but he can't see through magical darkness like we do. I point Plex at the monsters like a gun. Aviana, Shalkoc, and the Walleye dodge, but both Major Malleables fail. Fade runs towards one of the Major Malleables, hunting by sound, and bites it hard, then becomes invisible. Shalkoc punches the Malleable to death and chugs a potion of speed. He vibrates out of the grapple and punches the other Malleable very hard, you might say critically so, then shifts to Turtle Stance and moves back, screaming he needs help.</p><p>Now that the Dragonborn is close, I see his injuries are critical! Just then, a Slithering Bowel spits acid from behind us, blinding me and Shalkoc. Plex dodges it somehow. Fearghas dodges the spasming walls with impressive agility. He puts on his Glasses of True Seeing, and chugs a potion of Maximum Power. The Malleable shuffles towards Shalkoc, stepping over my invisible Fade. It hits Shalkoc, who shields himself with his Protective Wings.</p><p>Emilio gets to the Malleable and starts tearing it apart with his claws. I only hear concerning slashing sounds… Aviana grabs the Walleye and squeezes it, then pushes her talons into it. She is pulling it out of the wall and almost has it out, but a bit at the back is still sticking. I wobble towards Shalkoc, blind but guided by Fearghas. Plex is shouting into my ear a lot of lines to the general effect of \"let me at 'em!\" He is distracting me and I step into the pool of acidic blood… Metal crunches under my feet. I cast Heal on Shalkoc, unseasoned because I am spending way too many resources already.</p><p>Plex chugs a Potion of Heroism. None of us like where this is going. Plex grimaces like he is ready to bite. Level 13 Wizard by the way. I hope he does not bite me… Fade shreds the Bowel with her teeth and knocks it prone, but doesn't manage to kill it. Shalkoc brutally slaps the Bowel, which attempts to slither away into a hole under the acid blood. Emilio slashes it on its way, killing it.</p><p>Fearghas' magic reaches to Aviana, ripping blood from her and crystallising it into three spikes that stab the Malleable to death, and pin the corpse against a nearby wall. Aviana says \"hey the walls are helping us!\". A mouth in the wall opens up and replies \"No we're not.\". I stare at Fearghas in shock. I climb onto the fleshy island in the middle of the blood pool to get out of the acid. Something revolting bursts under my hand, and Emilio lends me a steadying… errr… claw. The celestial speaks to us; I try to answer, but Emilio snaps at it.</p><p>Now that we can see again, we can distinguish what is at the bottom of the blood pool. Low-quality clothes and chains like that of the slaves in Ukgluz, some useless items… and a lot of coins. Some of the coins are too deep to pick up without diving, but Fearghas uses Mage Hand.We estimate that there are around 9700 gold coins in there! Aviana casts Find Traps, with the same result as before; everything is a trap.</p><p>The problem is time. How much time are we willing to sacrifice to fish out gold coins? There are other items in the blood pool, stuck in the crevices so someone will have to dive down to retrieve it. There is a silk robe embroidered in gold, untouched by the acid. There is also jewelry, potentially magical. Fearghas casts Guidance on Aviana, she casts Resistance on herself, and prepares to dive to retrieve anything of value (that isn't money). She spots a gold chain with an opal set inside, and a gold locket. The harpy dives in, pushes the flaps of meat aside and retrieves all three items, taking minimal damage in the process, as she is resistant to acid.</p><p>Emilio picks up the gold chain set with the fire opal, and Aviana takes the gold locket with a painted portrait inside, as well as the silk robe with gold embroidery. Emilio is mesmerised by the fire opal. We start walking, trying and failing to find our way. The tunnel shrinks, space is getting too tight for comfort… we can either let it squeeze us into a direction, or try to resist and stand our ground. Fearghas breaks a gem of Leomund's Tiny Hut, shielding us all within a dome of force. The walls begin to crush the dome; if we had tried to resist this, we would probably have suffocated. The bubble doesn't move, and after about three minutes, the walls expand again. We move on.</p><p>We reach another area of magical darkness. Emilio and Fearghas walk in, I hesitate next to Shalkoc. Behind us, Aviana hears a trickling, then a rushing. A wall of greenish bile floods the tunnel towards us. We brace for it and withstand it, but Fearghas and Emilio are swept away, pushed into a wall, and dragged along. Fearghas manages to hold on, but Emilio is pushed farther from us, unable to find his footing. (he's failed 6 saves at this point and we are screaming)</p><p>Something tries to snatches Emilio before he can be swept into a hole but he wriggles out and falls into the hole. HE FINALLY SAVES, holding onto teeth at the edge of the maw. He pulls himself up and out of the gaping maw at the cost of extensive acid burns. Left behind, Shalkoc starts to stumble through the magical darkness. He uses Step of the Wind to catch up to Emilio, but I lose sight of him completely.</p><p>I cast Piercing the Veil and advance through the magical darkness. Fade caught up to us, she is invisible but her presence reassures me. Less so Plex' on my shoulder, but he hands me two bottles of very dark wine as thanks for carrying him. To maintain the balance of trade, I hand him a torch. I don't think it will help him see through the magic-wrought darkness, but it's symbolic, right? I'm worried about Emilio, I'm sure he is injured. I need to get to him. Fearghas went ahead of me, and caught up to him and Shalkoc. I can't be too far behind.</p><p>Plex drinks some of the same dark wine. The magic around him shifts, shapes into a spell just short of casting. An invisible Obscuroth slides just in front of us, and Plex releases his Thunderwave… triggering a MAJOR WILD MAGIC SURGE. THAT BLINDS ANYONE WITHIN 60 FEET OF PLEX. I'll need a 9th-level spell to remove that!</p><p>An unfinished flesh golem is speaking to Emilio and Fearghas, begging to be left alone because it's been tortured so much, all its scales ripped of. It has the head of a juvenile dragon, on a humanoid body. The Dragonflesh golem unleashes an Elemental breath on Emilio, knocking the life out of him. The golem cries that he is sorry, then returns to being an emotionless golem.</p><p>Aviana tears through the wall of flesh, emerging next to the others whom I was trying to catch up to! Fearghas shouted that Emilio was down, from the shouts I hear, he could be dying. Fearghas shouts to Aviana to put Emilio in the flask. Shalkoc runs up to Emilio and feeds him snot, which revives him with a lot of coughing. He weakly thanks Shalkoc, who is silenced and just gives a thumbs up. The celestial's voice congratulates Shalkoc for pouring snot down Emilio's throat while he was unconscious and dying from his wounds.</p><p>What a time to have ears.</p><p>I dash towards the noise made by my friends, Plex guiding me. How the tables turn. I call out to them and say I'm blind. Unable to cast a spell, I draw my sharp dagger and clutch it for dear life. I hear a Walleye fire a Psychic Ray, and Fearghas grumbles about Wizard bullshit. He summons a Spectral Hand and uses a spellgem of Dimension Door to drop Emilio and Shalkoc next to me, by grabbing them with the very spooky hand. Fearghas joins us, swinging his obsidian battleaxe. Level 13 Wizard by the way.</p><p>Plex offers to Fearghas to buy his Haste Potion. Fearghas retorts \"Plex, do you understand the concept of DYING?\" Aviana is getting attacked by something. Shalkoc gains inspiration as the Dragonflesh golem is proof of the existence of dragons. Plex uses Fey Step and disappears on the other side of a wall. Again. This time he is not far from us, and he casts Gravity Sinkhole. We discuss what to do with the Dragonflesh golem, and decide to put it out of its misery. I argue that I prefer to spend my most powerful spell on my friends rather than attempt to save a creature twisted beyond recognition, that has tried to kill us.</p><p>Plex shunts the Dragonflesh golem into the gaping maw. It screams in terror that it doesn't want to fall into that hole again, then sinks beneath the waves. I feel so sick… The darkness is suffocating… I can't fight it, it comes from my own eyes. Can we survive this? Will we even live to find the Sibriex? I can't break now, I am still needed. An Obscuroth wanders close to Fade, she tears it to shreds. The golem struggles in vain, shouting it doesn't want to go there again, not again. I can't shut out the screams, they sound too much like mine. The last we hear from the golem is that it doesn't want to \"receive any more mercy from that thing\". What a sickening thing to hear…</p><p>Emilio is completely unconcerned with his own survival, and enters Void Form again. I will dose this man with catfern and mavinsleaf if we ever get out of here. Abundantly. He applies Accrued Vitality and gives himself 26 temp HP, so maybe I will maybe it a slightly weaker brew. He slashes at a Bloater that is right in front of us. I get hit by a Tooth Spit from a Slithering Bowel, and dazed, but I keep my concentration on Fade. She dashes to us, but can't attack this turn.</p><p>Aviana shoves a repulsive enemy like Captain Falcon, straight into the maw in the middle of the room. Shalkoc hesitates to kill the Bloater because they explode when they die, he (rightfully so) fears he'll kill us (Emilio and me). I use a Mass Cure Wounds but it turns out to be weak sauce on everyone but me. Since I'm dazed, I can do nothing else…</p><p>Aviana gets critted and recovers a lot of resources! She brings up wanting to be bitten again. Fearghas casts Shocking Grasp on the Bloater, then slices at it with his axe, with precision entirely out of place for a Wizard! He moves away from us, past Fade, and drinks another Potion of Maximum Power. Fearghas spots a kind of flesh… workbench? in the distance. On it rests a heavy tome, and he gets this glint in his eyes…</p><p>Plex pushes the Bloater away from me, but closer to Fearghas. The monster tries to eat Emilio; he takes damage from the bite, then gets swallowed. Plex, still tiny, convincingly shouts at Emilio that he can, in fact, SEE in there! The Bowel next to Aviana tries to slither away, but she kicks it, sending it close enough to attack me, which it does. I take acid damage, and I am dazed again. This time I lose concentration and Fade dissipates in a burst of dark mist. Emilio somehow survives the Bloater's stomach acid but he is still severely injured. In clawing his way out, Emilio kills the Bloater, which explodes in a burst of acid. Our warlock emerges covered in acid, enraged.</p><p>The Bowel spits acid at me again. I can't think for the pain… We finally kill that last Bowel, and combat ends. I'm still blind, so I cling to anyone I can find. Fearghas picks up the tome; a Manual of Fiendish Flesh Golems. It is bound in many kinds of skin. He also finds a cloak woven in dragon scales, which he hands to Emilio. Shalkoc's last remaining braincell whispers to him to not run away on his own. Thank you so much, braincell.</p><p>I'm standing in place, paralysed with fear, when Fearghas walks up to me with a spell scroll and a spellgem, and removes my cloth allergy, and my blindness. I can finally see! And I see the blood in the pool in the middle of the room draining… The celestial's voice speaks to us not in our minds, but from below the pool, welcoming us.</p><p>Fearghas says out loud what we all think; we are in no condition for another fight and we absolutely need to rest. Emilio trades with Plex; one haste potion for Aviana, in exchange for Plex' last surviving chicken, which Emilio held onto. Fearghas prepares to put up the tiny hut, and we settle for a short rest next to the corpses, the acid puddles, and the empty pool of blood.</p>"

          "content": "<p>Aviana and Plex begin to argue, which ends as usual with Aviana grabbing Plex by the throat and squeezing, and them both disappearing. Teleportation out of here is impossible, so we assume they are still in the lair. Fearghas pulls out alchemical supplies, grumbles at our friends' disappearance, and we hear a sound coming from the north-east corridor. Fearghas says the telepathic bond ended when I bring it up, so we go look for them using our little feet, Emilio and I leaving a trail of blood from our injuries. Emilio's blood is black?!</p><p>We follow the twisting corridor to a room where we find a small Malleable that has… wings? Behind it is a large black egg. Emilio and Fearghas immediately blast the Malleable; its body melts into the ground, leaving feathers behind. The egg is warm and has a thin, slimy shell like a snake egg. Fearghas and Shalkoc say it looks nothing like a dragon egg… How do they know that? Not the time to ask. Something is moving sluggishly inside the egg. A humanoid hand seems to try to break through the shell, but is too weak to do so.</p><p>Before Fearghas can advise against this course of action, Emilio punches a hole through the egg, spilling fluid onto Emilio. Inside the egg is a gooey, disheveled… human woman. She is not happy, understandably so. She is small, blonde with green eyes, wearing black armour. Groggily, she asks where she is.</p><p>\"We're in the lair of a demon.\"</p><p>\"At the bottom of a lake.\"</p><p>\"In the Underdark.\"</p><p>5 iridescent feathers on the ground, untouched by the filth.</p><p>The blonde woman introduces herself as Kyrin. She is spooked by Shalkoc, towering over the party. She offers me a healing potion, then upon seeing Emilio, hands it to him instead. No hard feelings. He is hurt even worse than I am. She hands me a second healing potion. Emilio and me drink gratefully; a little of the tension goes out of him.</p><p>We return to the drained blood pool and Fearghas carries out the ritual for Leomund's Tiny Hut. Kyrin examines herself, checking for any unnatural growths that may have occurred while she was in the egg. Her shadow seems… strange. Doesn't move quite right, like it's lagging behind. I speak up, but Fearghas and Kyrin say I'm maybe seeing things. For a moment her shadow looked like mine… I must be imagining. Shalkoc cooks a thankfully vegetarian soup for Emilio and me.</p><p>I patch up Emilio with the bandages and herbs I have, then treat my own wounds. Shalkoc cooks a big medium rare steak for Kyrin, generously spiced with ginger. What meat is that? After handing her food to Kyrin, Shalkoc gives me a very soothing high-five with his Hand of Healing. Fearghas insistently asks Shalkoc where he got the steak from, which makes Kyrin hesitate until Shalkoc assures he bought the steak in the city. Shalkoc cooks more meat, this time some kind of chicken, as a snack for Fearghas.</p><p>The voice calls from the hole: \"Yes, pause and breathe in the tranquility, dear ones. The transition from the River to the boundless peace of Nirvana can be… intense. Rest is a balm, and I am here to offer comfort and guidance.\" Emilio shouts at it to shut up. Fearghas offers him a drink, he refuses. The dwarf insists, and pours him some dwarven ale. Kyrin enquires as to why Emilio is so angry at the voice. His voice seeps barely controlled fury as he speaks about the abysmal luck he's been having.</p><p>I offer to treat the party's remaining scrapes and hurts. They decline, but the celestial speaks in my mind, saying they are impressed with my dedication to heal, and they are eager to teach me to heal even better. I go positively green at that. Fearghas hands out potions of heroism, which we all drink as we steel ourselves.</p><p>The hole in the middle of the room is deep, with slippery walls. Fearghas suggests to cast Feather Fall, and just jump. AAAAAAAAAA. We float down into a large fleshy chamber, very humid and reeking. A big hole in the north wall leads to another chamber, presumably. We hear skittering, squelching steps. There is no sign of the Dragonflesh golem… The voice calls \"There you are, let me tend to you.\" Kyrin crouches behind a fleshy growth, all but disappearing from sight. Fearghas takes a steeling drink. I panic and use Shadowslip to disappear (and a major wild magic surge giving me a permanent 1d8 to my charisma checks!). Shalkoc uses Guardian of Nature: Primal Beast. Emilio glares.</p><p>The skittering comes closer… Hands, followed by elbows, more hands, more elbows… It straightens, a monster of arms and more arms that moves gingerly but dextrously. The monster cradles what remains of a celestial, or rather, many celestials stitched together. Bones sticking out of its fingers make dreadful claws. It asks us to come into its embrace. Emilio is enraged and threatens it. The monster responds with kindness…</p><p>We roll initiative.</p><p>The Perfected Deva takes two steps towards us, then teleports very close! It swings claws at Fearghas saying soothing things, to which Fearghas grumbles heartily. It encourages us to come closer, and sweeps across the entire area with its claws. It hits and grapples Fearghas, restraining him as it pulls him into its loving embrace. Urgh. Emilio gets hit and delivers a spicy Hellish Rebuke in reaction, but the boss saves and takes half damage. Emilio gets grappled as well. I get hit even in shadow form, breaking the spell, and grappled. Shalkoc blocks the attack with his wings. Kyrin is not noticed by the monster at all.</p><p>I resist the curse, try to escape the grapple, but fail. Shalkoc goes into Mantis Style and punches, then attempts to deliver a Stunning Strike, twice. He does damage, but both strikes fail to stun the Deva. He unleashes a Flurry of Blows, triggers Chromatic Hardening, and tries one last Stunning Strike, to no avail. He steps away, unharmed by the monster.</p><p>Emilio resists the curse like it's nothing. He casts Void Torrent, and teleports away; the acid does not seem to harm the Deva at all. He goes into Void Form and uses Accrued Vitality but it's weak sauce and he only gains 8 temp HP. Tragic. Kyrin gets cursed. The Deva tells us to not be afraid, which promptly frightens Shalkoc and me (I rolled with advantage, and thankfully, because that was a 4 and a 1…). Kyrin pulls out a SUN BLADE and swings at the monster in a sneak attack, dealing a ton of radiant damage. She follows it up with a Psychic Blade, but the attack misses. She runs to safety.</p><p>The Deva uses Helping Hand (a claw attack with free necrotic damage and spicy crit range) and crits Fearghas for a massive chunk of HP. He casts Misty Step to get the hell out, leaving me alone in the grapple. He casts Hold Monster from a spellgem.</p><p>\"Aerelia if this thing is immune to paralyse, I'm going to shank you.\" Karnack, 2025.</p><p>We don't find out because the Deva saves, and Fearghas is very upset. The Deva uses Gentle Light, spawning a cloud of magical darkness on Kyrin. The Deva uses To the Rescue, teleporting to Shalkoc and dragging me along. Pressed into its ribcage, I feel squirming underneath the skin. There is a lot of maggots in there… The Deva hits me, it's another crit. I take heavy damage, leaving me at low health with a half-baked plan.</p><p>The Deva has a legendary resistance, and I only get one shot at a healing burst. I levitate myself out of the grapple, run away 20 feet in the air, and apply a healing word on myself, healing barely anything. Shalkoc punches for all he's worth, with a lot of feeling, but does not stun the Deva, so he shifts to Turtle Stance. The Deva uses Don't be Afraid again, but we all endure the wave of fear without flinching. Emilio growls that he has seen much worse in the void, and pummels it with an Eldritch Blast. Two beams hit, and Emilio uses Grasp of Hadar to drag the Deva closer to him.</p><p>The monster unleashes another wave of fear, terrifying Shalkoc and Kyrin. It uses Empathy/Loneliness as a reaction to her failing the save, forcing us to make two other saves which she barely passes, at the cost of light psychic damage. She sidesteps out of the magical darkness and throws a Psychic Blade because she is frightened and unable to move closer.</p><p>The Deva feels lonely and teleports to Kyrin, who flips it off as a free action. \"What a gentle gesture,\" it sighs. \"Oh I've got a gesture for you all right!\" She says. Fearghas steps in cat puke IRL then casts Scorching Ray. It would deal massive damage, but the Deva uses a Legendary Resistance! Then Fearghas chucks a Spiritual Weapon at it. The Deva uses a legendary action to attack Kyrin on Fearghas' turn, she uses her Uncanny Dodge to halve the damage.</p><p>The Deva hits Kyrin again, taking half her life in one blow. She then hits me; I drop to 1 HP and the Death Ward dissipates! I stop concentrating on Levitate and float to the ground. Through the Staff of Power, I cast Wall of Force and put myself in an unbreakable box to buy time. A Healing Word on Shalkoc gives him courage to approach the enemy and punch the living daylight out of it. Emilio gets close and readies up a spell. The Deva uses a Helping Hand on Kyrin, who dodges it perfectly. Close call!</p><p>Kyrin gets an otherworldly inspiration called Karnack; she hides, applies Shadow Strike to increase her reach, then attacks with a melee Psychic Blade, and marks the enemy's soul. She books it to a safe distance. A new wave of fear rolls out from the Deva, but none of us are afraid! Fearghas commands his Spiritual Weapon to attack, then prepares a Scorching Ray.</p><p>Another wave of fear hits us, and this time it's too much for everyone but Fearghas. Shalkoc indirectly saves my life by using a Dreamfeather and allowing me to reroll, avoiding psychic damage from Empathy/Loneliness. Kyrin gets hit by it but saves, barely surviving. On its turn, the Deva goes to her. Shalkoc tries an attack of opportunity, but is hit by a wild magic surge that inflicts disadvantage on all his attack rolls, cancelling the advantage from his future sight. Kyrin gets hit by Helping Hand, and goes down. The Deva jumps back to Shalkoc's rescue and bumps into my Wall of Force. Eyes lock onto me and hands feel at the Wall of Force, looking in vain for an opening. It looks disappointed, but it waits for my barrier to fall off.</p><p>Emilio and Fearghas unleash their readied spells, Tasha's Mind Whip and Scorching Ray. The Deva rolls a critical save on the mind whip and does not use resistance… Five of Fearghas' rays hit, and the Deva uses Legendary Resistance!</p><p>Steeling myself, I drop concentration on the Wall of Force. The hands reach out to me as I am defenseless, critically injured, but I am faster. Ripping my spellwards from my wrists, clutching the Staff of Power, I channel my strongest healing spell. A torrent of positive energy rushes towards the Deva, closing all wounds but also feeding the maggots inside and making them multiply until the creature's skin tears and the disgusting things burst out. The Deva's twisted body crumples, and the ruined face looks up at me. In a last whisper, it says \"Thank you\". For a moment I am filled with serenity and thoughts of the dawn's light, just like the day I received my staff.</p><p>Maggots are swarming all over. I step around them, casting a Healing Word on myself, and start toward the unconscious Kyrin. Shalkoc makes short work of the maggots with a fire breath, popping them like corn. Combat ends at last, and I rush over to Kyrin and get her back on her feet. Fearghas harvests the maggots, while telling Shalkoc to NOT eat them or even pick them up. He tries to get materials from the Deva's corpse, but it's too corrupted to make anything out of.</p><p>Kyrin finds 15 gleaming Springseeds. I scoop them up carefully and put them in my bag of herbs, hoping to plant them on Promise soon. We consider taking another rest, but the lair begins to quake and spasm. Again a rushing sound comes towards us from above. We cannot take another wave of bile now! I can confirm that we are in a stomach, urgh. The hole up north should be a throat of sorts; we dash into it, chased by the rushing sound becoming louder behind us. I block the tunnel with a Wall of Force as soon as we are through, but if the wall is unbreakable, the sticky walls of flesh will not hold much longer. We burst out of the sticky throat into a mouth with several rows of enormous teeth, closed.</p><p>Fearghas casts Shocking Grasp to get the creature to open its mouth, and his Lich Hand to tickle the uvula. It doesn't work out, so Emilio tries with a Mage Hand, but fails miserably. Kyrin stabs the tongue with her Psychic Blade. The blade goes in to the hilt, but we see no wound. The tongue rises to crush us against the roof of the mouth, but the teeth are cracking open. A wall of water rushes in…</p><p>Fearghas and Emilio very quickly put their heads together, talking quickly about magic. They come to the conclusion that teleportation should now be possible. Fearghas says \"Get in my mouth!\" and nobody understands until he polymorphs himself into a whale and takes a deep breath, filling his mouth with air. We all hop in.</p><p>\"I am the coo of the sea!\" Fearghas, 1497.</p><p>The water is a lot murkier, polluted with blood and bile. Whaleghas spots small Aboleths in the water. He swims up, and beaches himself on a… beach, and kindly opens his mouth to let us out. He reverts to his true form spitting, saying one of us tastes awful. Emilio apologises.</p><p>We are in a cave we've never seen before. Kyrin suggests a Detect Magic spell, so I take out my wand and give it a happy little wave. Kyrin seems to see just fine, she is intently looking around the cavern as if searching for something. We discuss our options; do we return to Fearghas' mansion in Ukgluz, or teleport to Promise? We quickly brief Kyrin on our… history with the Duergar. And the Drow of House Vandree… We decide to head back to Fearghas' mansion, on foot. Fearghas pops a spellgem of Find the Path.</p><p>We are on the other side of the lake, so it isn't far, but we have to go through the water again. Not a problem, as Fearghas turns back to Whaleghas to ferry us across. On the way, Kyrin says she was employed by the Drow to investigate Ukgluz, then tried to infiltrate Lessia with the Duergar, but she messed up, and can't be seen by them now. The last thing she remembers is Matron Vandree telling her she will never disappoint her again, and the next thing she knew she woke up in a gooey egg in the lair. The whale noises stop at that, then resume, and Whaleghas sneakily slaps Shalkoc with his tongue. Whalegas spits us all out on the other side of the lake, on the side of Ukgluz. The mutated larvae here have grown even larger…</p><p>Fearghas, back to dwarf form, grumbles about \"mahr-might taste\" again, and blames Shalkoc, who is offended. We make for Ukgluz, but Kyrin stops. She fears being recognised. Anxiously, she asks us not to tell on her as she shapeshifts into a child with the look of an urchin. Although she is smaller, her shadow grows larger. Irritatedly, she stomps on it and mutters at it under her breath. Her shadow behaves, and with child-Kyrin in tow, we walk to Ukgluz. Fearghas sticks the hat on his head and reminds us that we are all pretending to be his slaves.</p><p>As we reach the alleyway where the manor is, Fearghas stops abruptly. We all collide into him, which amuses a Duergar nearby, who asks how he will punish his slaves for this, and thankfully leaves. Right in front of the manor's invisible door is one of the Duergar's statues. Apparently these are the \"demon engines\" or are powered by them. It hasn't noticed us yet.</p><p>We investigate a little, then sneak past the statue. It doesn't move and we slip into the mansion unnoticed. Fearghas officially welcomes us to the Chateau de MacAllistar. We chill and get Kyrin up to speed about why we were in the Sibriex lair. Fearghas mentions, with no ill intentions I'm sure, that we went into the lair because I insisted on it. We nearly died in there… Suddenly choked with guilt, I excuse myself to the kitchen to make tea, but Kyrin thanks me for saving her, that if we hadn't gone into the lair, she would have been warped into a monster. I try to reply, but only squeak, and hurry to the kitchen, asking Shalkoc if we can make some cookies for everyone, too.</p><p>Fearghas, Emilio, and Kyrin discuss origins, reputation, and casual racism in the dining hall. We return with tea and snacks. Fearghas contacts Aviana with a Sending, asking where she and Plex are, and whether they are both safe. Aviana replies very tensely with \"where the fuck are you\", \"what is this bullshit\", and something about her dress being all dirty, and she was done with sewers, and she was done with filthy places! And this is more than 25 words for sure.</p>"

I ask if Fearghas can contact them telepathically, but that Discord call ended while I was forcefully offline thanks to Mind Blank.</p><p>We leave to look for our missing companions, but find instead a... Minor Malleable? With wings? Emilio and Fearghas blast it dead, we pick up 5 dreamfeathers and share them among us. There is a large black snake-like egg, with movement inside. Emilio punches it open and a petite woman comes out, a human who woke up from the worst nap ever.</p><p>We introduce ourselves and explain to her where she is. Her name is Kyrin and she has very little idea how she got here, poor soul. She gives healing potions to Emilio and me after seeing how beaten up we are, how nice! The potions that is, not the beating up part.</p><p>We return to the blood pool room and take a short rest in the bubble. There is a lot of healing to be done, Shalkoc cooks a big steak for Kyrin which prompts relentless questioning from Fearghas to ascertain the origin of the meat. Bless this dwarf. Kyrin's shadow seems odd, but I brush it off as imagination.</p><p>The celestial's voice encourages us to rest, and Emilio snaps at it. Fearghas offers him ale, for his nerves. Emilio refuses. Fearghas insists. Kyrin asks why he is so angry (Emilio, not Fearghas, understandable mistake dear reader). Emilio grumbles about his terrible luck. The celestial wants to teach me to heal better. Hard pass. I'm fine. Nuh-uh.</p><p>After some much needed R&amp;R, we jump down the maw in the middle of the room, and live thanks to Fearghas' Feather Fall spell. We end up in a large, disgusting, vaguely round cavern. No sign of the monsters we chucked into that hole last time, I'm sure that's nothing to worry about. Something is coming! Kyrin hides so well I can't see her at all. I panic and slip into my shadow. Fearghas quaffs some ale. Shalkoc casts a spell to make his muscles bigger. Emilio glares.</p><p>We're attacked? By a monster with FAR too many hands, claiming it just wants a hug. It has the celestial's voice, but the body is corrupted beyond recognition and twisted into a fiend. In spite of this, it kept its good intentions and keeps trying to help us, which turns into trying to kill us.</p><p>\"Aerelia if this thing is immune to paralyse, I'm going to shank you.\" Karnack, 2025.</p><p>It's a hard battle, the Perfected Deva always targets the lowest health character to \"help\" them, and it grapples like a son of a kobold too. It teleports, inflicts fear, and generally hits like a truck. Kyrin flips it off as a free action. I'm grappled within an inch of my life and I realise that under the creature's skin, maggots are teeming. If they could teem a bit more, we could get interesting results. Speaking from experience.</p><p>We hatch a plan. Emilio and Fearghas ready their spells to hit the Deva on my turn and force it to use its legendary resistance. I put myself in a box, that is Wall of Force, because I am at 1 HP and my Death Ward triggered. Kyrin goes down despite some sick dodges, but all is in readiness. I drop concentration on Wall of Force, take off my spellwards, and channel for all I'm worth.</p><p>I CAST HEAL AT 9TH LEVEL!</p><p>According to plan, the maggots multiply and the boss explodes! It thanks me in a last whisper just before Shalkoc grills all the maggots with a dragon breath. Do not eat the maggots. I rush to help Kyrin but it's too soon to celebrate, as another wave of bile is coming for us. We run into the only exit, a sticky tunnel that I block with a Wall of Force. This only buys us a little time, as the flood of bile is so bad, the throat-like tunnel will give out before my spell does. We exit the tunnel into a huge mouth with several rows of teeth, firmly shut.</p><p>We think on how to escape, but soon Fearghas says \"Get in my mouth!\"</p><p>Nobody knows what he is talking about. (except Emilio for meta reasons)</p><p>He polymorphs into a sperm whale.</p><p>Everybody knows what he is talking about.</p><p>Shalkoc gets slapped by a tongue, one of us tastes like Marmite, we are carried to freedom by the glorious form of Whaleghas.</p><p>\"I am the coo of the sea!\" Fearghas 1497.</p><p>After learning Kyrin is a changeling, we decide to return to the Chateau de MacAllistar in Ukgluz. We dodge a statue that was staring at the door, thankfully without consequences (right?), get in, chat over tea and cookies, and send a Message spell to Aviana, with a response that is mostly grumbling about her dress being all dirty.</p>"

          "content": "<p>While the rest of us are safe in the Chateau de MacAllistar sipping tea and eating cookies, Aviana and Plex are still in the Sibriex lair, fighting for their lives. They do a very respectable amount of ripping and tearing until it's done, and find loot equal to 1700 gold (850gp each). Their resources all but spent, they are attacked by a giant ooze that… promptly dies by melting away as it moves, flooding the entire hall in blood and bile and other disgusting things. (This is when Aviana gets Fearghas' message spell, as she was waist-high in that ichor with Plex on her shoulder.)</p><p>They get to one closed butthole and ponder how to get out. Aviana ponders tearing it a new one, literally, but decides against it and tries to pry open the existing one. It does not work out, as she is too grossed out, and attempts to use Plex as a towel to avoid touching it. Plex is at 8 HP. He has some ideas, none of them good. He settles on Prestidigitation, which triggers an irrelevant minor surge, to clean up Aviana so she doesn't use him as a towel. Plex hands Aviana a slice of cloth cut from a tent, from the time we first met Emilio.</p><p>Plex casts Pulse Wave to force the butthole open. They exit the lair into pitch-black water. Below them is a mountain of waste from the lair; some things within are shimmering. There are 3 pyropes and 3 jades, which Plex grabs with his mage hand. Because of the earlier surge that teleported Fearghas to the Plane of Water, both Aviana and Plex know where Fearghas is, and they know where his manor is. Plex casts a Dimension Door to the surface, but Aviana doesn't fit through it, not just because she is too big but also because Plex is too small (he is still tiny).</p><p>Aviana grabs Plex, who chugs snot to survive her Vice Grip. This circumvents the issue with Dimension Door, and they teleport to the surface. Plex would 100% have died without the snot. They swim ashore; they know where to go, but must be sneaky about it to not be taken for runaway slaves by the Duergar again. They are immediately spotted by two Duergar who call out to them.</p><p>Plex stands on Aviana's shoulder and says hello, which confuses the Duergar because they can't see the tiny Plex. He says he wants to get into Ukgluz to meet a friend. The Duergar demand to know what they were doing, and who owns them. Plex guesses he is owned by Mannon, who is not there at the moment. The Duergar call for reinforcments. Plex requests to be grabbed by Aviana again, and casts Vortex Warp at 4th level on himself to teleport into Ukgluz.</p><p>This of course attracts a lot of attention and soon 15 guards are running after them. Plex panics, casts Fey Step and teleports 20ft to the East. Fearghas' Plex-sense is tingling; he gets a splitting headache out of nowhere, sends a Message to Aviana, who screams in answer. Fearghas gets The Look (tm) on his face as he says Plex and Aviana are running amok in the city, and he needs to go and get them. We all go out to look for our… friends.</p><p>We soon hear a commotion three streets over, of a now-normal-size harpy running like Jack Sparrow shouting \"What did I do? Stop chasing me!\". She runs into a market stall, prompting more screaming that guides Fearghas and the rest of us towards them. Plex pockets a piece of cloth, Aviana runs into soot and her face is now black. She spots Fearghas dashing towards her with The Look (tm) on his face. Aviana is chased by 20 guards shouting to stop these runaway slaves. Plex teleports him and Aviana a short distance.</p><p>Fearghas says \"play along\" and cracks both of them on the head with his staff, shouting at them. I try to stop the violence, to no avail. Emilio nods like this is the most reasonable thing. Fearghas apologises to the Duergar and makes a good show of a repentant master. The Duergar are visibly losing brain cells, and say that they will have to report this and Fearghas is to show up at the court house by tomorrow for the report.</p><p>The Duergar insists that Fearghas puts his slaves in chains, so Aviana says she brought her own chain and pulls out a regular chain, a pair of manacles, and finally the Null-Steel chain. Fearghas chains Aviana up with the regular chain, and Plex with the Null-Steel chain, and we head back into the manor the moment the guards have their backs turned. Fearghas hesitates to unchain Plex, who is very confused about the Duergar (he has never met them directly). Fearghas explains. Plex is confused as to who Fearghas can't be the slave.</p><p>Aviana is stuck in the steel chain and calls Fearghas for help. Kyrin meets Aviana for the first time as her face is black with soot. Fearghas cleans her up with Prestidigitation, and makes the introductions with Kyrin. I hand Aviana a cookie and gain inspiration, yay!. Kyrin is happily munching away on more treats, looking like a child with chocolate smudged on her nose.</p><p>Aviana wants to open a cookie business because she thinks Kyrin is adorable. I remind her that we are now in legal trouble with the Duergar, and we are summoned to Hell within the week, not to mention we are planning an ambush on Matron Vandree. We also need to retrieve the Eye of Dahak from the Drow to help the king of Lessia before we can go back to fulfilling our contracts with Hell. Kyrin says she knows where the Drow are. Or… were. She's not sure how long she was in the egg. She describes the place where the Drow where, a place I recognise. We both grimace as we speak about Matron Vandree.</p><p>Aviana grumbles very much about how Fearghas' manor looks, and that it needs a complete makeover. We argue there are more pressing matters, i.e. resting because we are all beaten up. Fearghas gives me a triggered spellgem of Private Sanctum. To release the spell, I need to say Execute in Dwarven. Kyrin pulls out an ink-black piece of cloth and slaps it down on the floor, then climbs down into it. It's a Portable Hole! She suggests using it to sneak out of the city, which will cause issues with bags of holding, but this is something we are aware of (thankfully).</p><p>Kyrin takes the appearance of Aviana, at her urging. Aviana is star-struck and has her try on a silk robe, and a dress. Fearghas sighs and disappears into the cellar with the intention to drink himself silly. The servants bring a comfortable little pad for Emilio and put it in a corner, as if he was a grumpy little cat; surprisingly he is sitting at the table and having cookies with the rest of us. <s>Emolio</s></p><p>I use my last spell slot, and channel to heighten it from level 5 to level 8, and cast Remove Curse on Plex. He can speak again without music playing in the background, and he is again of reasonable size.</p><p>We take a long rest. I HAVE HP AGAIN.</p><p>(Now the new rest rules come into effect; the next long rest we can take is on Saturday.)</p><p>We are having breakfast the next day and discussing our plans when Matron Vandree speaks into my mind:</p><div><p>Naami. My little traitor.</p></div><div><p>Did you think your disloyalty would go unnoticed?</p></div><div><p>A little bird, fluttering through King Dimzad’s halls, sang me such a lovely song.</p></div><div><p>It spoke of a stolen sceptre, a clever little plan... and you. The bait. Squirming so prettily in the jaws of a trap meant for me.</p></div><div><p>But fret not, little one. That shall not be your fate.</p></div><div><p>No - yours will be a special one.</p></div><p>For you will soon learn what fate awaits those foolish enough to betray me - and anyone they've ever held dear.</p><p>Shaking, I repeat these words to the party. She will hurt Madr. Emilio and Kyrin comfort me, and Fearghas promises we will take care of it. Aviana suggests making Matron Vandree disappears. We say that is the idea, and nothing short of it will free Kyrin and me from her influence.</p><p>Shalkoc cooks up a feast for us, in which he eagerly takes part. Plex and Aviana give 1 pyrope and 2 jades to Fearghas. Kyrin gives me a potion of greater healing. Fearghas cooks up some potions, but the alchemy goes awry.</p><p>We have to exile Shalkoc to the other end of the manor to drink tea, ale, and potions, as all liquids still turn to lukewarm water when he is within 60 feet.</p><p>Plex turns himself and Aviana tiny so they can sneak better. Emilio scoops up Aviana and hides her in his breast pocket. I lift Plex, scold him, and gently place him in my bag with instructions to not disturb my herbs! Fearghas casts Rary's Telepathic Bond, which I am again excluded from, my mind is still blank... We leave the mansion. Fearghas is tracking mud everywhere for a week because of a surge. I offer to cast Remove Curse on him, but he advises me not to spend this many resources.</p><p>We head to the market as I need to replenish my healer's supplies. Fearghas buys me 2 healer's kits, and I sneakily hand him the money when we are out of sight. Fearghas then buys alchemical supplies. Aviana bullies him into buying her a new mug, which grants her inspiration as it is useless.</p><p>We head to the king's hall to speak to Dimzad. Kyrin, who transformed into a Duergar, so she stays outside to \"watch over the slaves\", that is the rest of us, while Fearghas goes in to speak with the king. Kyrin grumbles at this, she wanted to investigate the hall for something hidden, or someone disguised. Fearghas solves her concern by using a See Invisibility gem.</p><p>One of the seats to the king's right is empty; last time, a priest was sitting there. The king greets him by saying \"Out of your portal, are you?\". Fearghas says the Matron is aware of the ambush, and that she has a spy in Dimzad's court. He furrows his brows at this, says he suspected something as some scrying sensors were recently found, one of those at the entrance of Fearghas' portal. (I assume he means the door to the manor.) The sensors were destroyed (presumably this is why an armour was at the door?), but Dimzad says the plans have changed, and asks Fearghas what he is planning to do.</p><p>Fearghas says he assumes the Matron will come get me, and also he plans to investigate a camping location of the Drows'. Dimzad asks why he should let the Halfling (me) go. Fearghas says that I am in his employ and care. Dimzad asks why he should let either of us go, as us surface-dwellers don't know how to use Null-Steel…</p><p>Fearghas warns us telepathically, and the hall's doors begin to close! Fearghas teleports back to us with a Dimension Door cast with a Subtle Mind Crystal to escape being taken prisoner. The plan is now to run. The moment we start running, statues (demon engines) advance towards us, carrying black nets of Null-Steel.</p><p>Aviana hops out of Emilio's pocket and chugs a Potion of Giant Size. Plex drops concentration on the spell that made him tiny, and casts Adjust Density on Aviana to halve her density and increase her jump distance. She uses Legendary Vigor to further increase it. Fearghas casts Feather Fall on us so we don't straight up die.</p><p>Aviana scoops us all up and jumps 700 meters up and forward, to not bonk her head on the ceiling (close call). Kyrin and me point to the Drows' camping site as we are gliding through the air; the campsite is empty, and we float far past it. We end up about 3km from the city gates. Aviana approaches the ground and we wriggle out of her grasp to avoid being caught in the explosion from the Thunderfeet Footwraps. All of us jump and float down before she lands, but Emilio is too fancy for this and uses his Robe of Stars to disappear from this reality and reappear a short moment later.</p><p>Aviana gently floats down, triggering an explosion, but she takes the superhero landing pose. It looks very different when she isn't slamming down into the ground, but she is having a great time. Plex missed the landing a bit, and emerges from underneath a large mushroom cap somehow. Aviana stomps over to us, Fearghas asks if everyone is alive, and Emilio wants to fly again. Adrenalin junkie…</p><p>We agree to return to the campsite to look for clues. It's uncomfortably close to Ukgluz, but needs must. Emilio gives a heartfelt compliment to Fearghas on his excellent use of Dimension Door; he feels invigorated. Aviana carries Emilio up on her shoulder to repay the favour of him carrying her in his pocket earlier. He is loving the height.</p><p>We get to the campside, and from Ukgluz we see several demon engines coming in our general direction. We decide to hide nearby and wait for the searching to die down. Aviana puts us all in a potato sack and climbs up to a ledge where we hole up in a cavern that is big enough even for her in giant mode. As we arrive in the cavern, a lage lizard slithers away, deciding it isn't messing with something the size of Aviana. Kyrin scouts further into the cavern, finding only large lizard eggs. Shalkoc gets a hungry look in his eyes and sneaks off towards the eggs until we grab him by the scruff of the neck.</p><p>We sit down to keep watch; around 30 demon engines are roaming the area, and after around 3 hours they start to head back towards Ukgluz. After 6 hours, they are all gone. In the meantime, Fearghas looks for herbs and finds some Shimmerleaf, which he coaxes to grow with magic from a gem. I help him out with herbs as he starts brewing. Aviana inspires him to do his best by flexing. He brews up 1 Potion of Supreme Healing. Kyrin takes out a notepad and starts sketching the area, adding some notes. Kyrin conjures up a Mage Hand to pick a blue flower she spotted. She picks two, gives me one which I put in my hair, and presses the other into a book, which gives her inspiration!</p><p>Plex summons a Mage Hand to… fight Kyrin's Mage Hand? He only gets a moderate surge that restrains him for a day. The Mage Hand backfired and is now holding him very tight. Aviana wants to chain him up to carry him like a bag. Or tie him up with a hempen rope. Or a jungle vine, whatever he prefers. He can't struggle anyway, and is fine being carried around, but he would much prefer if Fearghas carried him around on Tenser's Floating Disk for a day. Fearghas grumbles, but Plex argues he owes him a favour. Fearghas casts Tenser's Floating Disk and Aviana places Plex on it. She spins the disk.</p><p>We climb down with Aviana's help and approach the camp; Aviana stays on the ledge as she is too noticeable, and could easily jump to us in an emergency. There isn't much here, and footprints make it clear that this place has been searched by the Duergar. Fearghas casts Detect Magic. I wave my wand to do the same. We see remains of divination magic, and high-level conjuration magic… that's traces of a Plane Shift spell!</p><p>\"Fearghas, where did you park Plex?\" Aerelia.</p><p>Plex was parked next to the remains of the campfire; staring into the ashes, he spots bones… weird bones he's never seen before, they're a little transparent with an iridescent shimmer. He picks them up with his Mage Hand. The bones used to belong to a magical creature, it still holds faint conjuration magic. Plex licks the bones, it tastes surprisingly fishy, a lot like his Fishy Magic.</p><p>Wait… I've eaten this fish before, on my travels with the Drow. At a time when we were travelling through deeper levels and food was scarce, the Matron left saying she would get food from the castle, Plane Shifted away, and returned with a barrel full of these fish. When I asked which waters she got these from, she chuckled and said \"there is no water there, they just float\".</p><p>I describe the fish I remember, and Fearghas conjures up an illusion, both of us working out an accurate image of the creature. None of us knows what this is. Shalkoc tries to eat the illusion. I mention the Drow having a place in the Shadowfell where they would stay, which makes Plex do a big frown. Kyrin gives the camp a last good look and spots an elusive little emblem of two crossed daggers. It's made of a mate metal that doesn't reflect light; I immediately recognise the crest of House Vandree. Assassins who worked for House Vandree wore this in the centre of their chest. Thin leather straps lie next to it, one of them stained with blood. I suggest a scrying spell.</p><p>We return to where Aviana was waiting, but on the way, Fearghas and me are spotted by the lookouts on the walls of Ukgluz… the gates open and 12 demon engines charge towards us! Aviana bids goodbye to the lizard mum who she was having a deep conversation with, and jumps down to help us.</p><p>Fearghas shouts \"Hop on!\" and polymorphs into a giant dinosaur bird! (Quetzalcoatlus) We get on Quetzalcoatlhus MacAllistar, Aviana wonders if her wings would look like this if she didn't have any feathers, what a sad thought. Emilio is happily sitting on the dinosaur, aura farming. We get away, land, and Fearghas drops Polymorph to cast… Plane Shift?! Where are we going?</p><p>We appear in a tower in a demiplane. Fearghas says it belonged to another wizard, who seems to have passed on and, in scientific terms, \"he called dibs\". We climb the stairs to a room which floor tiles are carved with letters and numbers, and the edges of the room are littered with bones. Fearghas warns us to not go into that room alone. We climb up to the library, a room that makes Fearghas very happy. He starts researching the fish. Another room in the library holds an empty altar and glowing runes that look similar to the ones on the Void Explorer's Spellbook that Fearghas pulled out in the Sibriex lair, which caused Emilio to lose control… Fearghas says the room is no longer trapped, and Kyrin walks in there unharmed. Fearghas, Plex, and me research the golden fish. Plex has to cast Comprehend Languages to read any of the books because he does not know how to read.</p><p>Aviana and Emilio were left behind on the floor we arrived in. Emilio is anxious, doesn't feel safe. Aviana encourages him to follow the rest of us, but she is too big to fit through the staircase, so he goes alone. Into the room with the letters. The one we should never be alone in. He climbs up the stairs, and ends up… at the bottom of the stairs, unable to leave the room. Fearghas gets a Skype notification in his head that someone intruded into the tower. He goes to get Emilio, getting him unstuck. Emilio joins us in the library… and immediately sees the purplish runes on the floor of the other room. His gauntlets react even at this distance. He asks Fearghas why he has void runes in the tower, he replies they came with the tower when he took over.</p><p>Emilio is not feeling good because of the runes, I offer help but he brushes me off roughly. Fearghas hands me the \"Note to Future Self\" they previously found in the tower. I read it with great fascination, and eventually Fearghas finds information on the fish! It's a space guppy, native to the Astral Plane. Led by Fearghas, we climb up to the Greenhouse. I am fascinated by everything, and lag behind a bit. When I join the rest of the party on the floor above, it's very overgrown and there is a giant dead plant. Fearghas mentions having to fight it.</p><p>Another floor up is a room-wide device that can enhance magic items. It's crazy messy in there, so I tease Fearghas about it. Above is the Observatory, a room where the floor looks like a star chart and most of the space is taken up by a massive telescope. Fearghas instructs me on how to use it, and I hop on the chair and look for Ildilas. It doesn't look so different from when I left it… except it waves like a mirage, only Ildilas, like something is distorting the image. The desert in the centre of the island… maybe has expanded? It's hard to tell, the image is so distorted, and I've only seen maps a few times. The coastline is the same, but the sea just off the island seems shallower, lighter in colour, like the sea floor is raised, in a pattern reminiscent of tree roots jutting from a stump. It faintly reminds me of something I read once, or heard from an elderly relative. Ley lines? I can't recall…</p><p>We try to search the Astral Plane for a castle but it's a needle in a haystack situation. That being said… we do have time. Fearghas summons an Unseen Servant to clean up the tower so he doesn't have to do it himself. Wizards… I ask Fearghas if we are safe in the tower, if the Matron can come get me here. He's pretty sure she could not, or at least it would be as tough as it's going to get for her!</p><p>We suggest spending some time in the tower to research:</p><ul><li><p>Matron Vandree, on the off chance we find anything</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The Astral Plane and a castle with space guppies</p></li><li><p>Dragon aspects, their eyes, effects on mortal races, dragon sickness</p></li><li><p>Ley lines</p></li><li><p>Duergar religion and scepters</p></li></ul><p>I also said I wanted to examine everyone, with their permission, because we sustained severe wounds in the recent fights, and I want to make sure we're all okay before we get into another battle.</p>"

          "content": "<p><strong>Wednesday 29</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> of Nonus, 1497</strong></p><p><strong>01:23</strong></p><p>Ley lines are rivers of mana left over by the mixing of positive and negative energy. The high elves of Aethel'eren (an island far east of Quadira) use ley lines in their magic.</p><p>A temple to Nethys, goddess of magic, buried under the Redwind Sands, could contain information about lichdom.</p><p>Shadows are reflections of strong emotions or events in the Material Plane that leave echoes in the Shadowfell. This can also happen the other way around, though it is a lot rarer.</p><p>Fearghas reads us the Duergar Creation Myth, as told by the Dwarves. In the tower, we find another version, as told by the Duergar. It is quite different… The Duergar claim they disobeyed their god Torag out of curiosity and yearning for understanding, and were burnt by Azgal, the Ebon Fire. The Duergar look down on the other Dwarves for their blind obedience to Torag. In Ukgluz, there was a temple to Azgal, and the stolen scepter was the Scepter of Azgal.</p><p>Fearghas, Plex, Kyrin, and myself have been doing research in the library. Aviana has been playing chess with Emilio and bugging Fearghas for a gravity-enhanced gym room. Aviana won every chess game by virtue of neither her, nor Emilio knowing the rules. They gambled, and somehow Emilio won 800 gold?! I learn that last time Plex' curse tried to teleport him away from the tower, he got stuck in a teleportation loop between the curse pulling him away, and the tower pulling him back, for hours. Which made him very nauseous.</p><p>After reading Draconic Aspects and their Kin, we theorise that the eye of Dahak held by the king of Lessia contains half the dragon's soul. We suspect it's the left eye, that of evil. How frightening… where would the right eye have gone? Does Vrazzak the Lich have it? We attempt to figure out whether Plex is left-handed or right-handed to judge if he is evil. Aviana chucks a ball at him to see which hand he catches it with. He catches it with telekinesis. All our plans are in tatters.</p><p>We wonder if Dahak's right eye might cure the king of Lessia.</p><p>Vrazzak supposedly is friends with Dam'ghur (the undead mage whom we beat up after Shalkoc picked up his little finger that he is now waving around as a wand). Their friendship consists of trying to kill each other. If we want to find out more (read: when we have time to find out more), we could start in the Redwind Sands!</p><p>Kyrin's shadow wiggles of its own volition. She does not know why. We talk about how both the Shadowfell and the Feywild are very susceptible to emotion and intent. Plex says the Shadowfell is… taking over the Feywild? That's terrifying! Shalkoc says we should go to Hell to meet Zariel, as she wants to meet \"the angel slayer\" (that's me). Emilio suggests he can claim to be the angel slayer, to protect me. Shalkoc says I can just pretend I am a regular angel slayer. What in the world. Kyrin gives me a cookie.</p><p>We shuffle to bed at 2am.</p><p>Plex is dragged to bed while still restrained on his floating disc.</p><p>WE SLIP ON THE STAIRS BECAUSE PLEX TRAPPED THEM WITH SOAP.</p><p>Ouchie.</p><p>Fearghas wants to kill Plex. He cleans up the stairs with Prestidigitation. I help Plex back to his disc, as he was knocked off by most of us tumbling down the stairs. We end up in the kitchen for a 2am snack before going to bed. Totally did not go to the wrong floor of the tower, we would never. I call dibs on the tiny room with the plants. Fearghas finds a hidden door behind the wall of one of the toilets. <s>the diarrhea room</s> Shalkoc tests every bed to find the most comfortable one. Fearghas finds a Dispelling Stone, and deposits Plex into a hammock. Fearghas wanders to a room adjacent to the plant room I picked, and he drops into a spike pit?! I rush to help him, and he only mutters \"ow\". I throw him a rope and he climbs out, muttering.</p><p>The room seems full of stolen stuff, and it contains a wand that makes Fearghas feel so tired… it's a Wand of Catnap! Actually quite a powerful item. Plex rolls around his hammock with great satisfaction, until he falls out. Fearghas pauses his bedtime reading to say \"I'm not getting him\". Plex tries to get back to the hammock. We have pleasant quiet for the rest of the night.</p><hr><p><strong>Wednesday 29</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> of Nonus, 1497</strong></p><p><strong>10:22</strong></p><p><strong>Short rest</strong></p><p>On our way to get breakfast, we descend to the <s>ouija room</s> letter room. Plex is there, and he made a lineart of his face with the bones littering the room. What. We need to:</p><ul><li><p>figure out where the Drow are</p></li><li><p>deal with Shalkoc's and Fearghas' contracts</p></li><li><p>figure out what is happening with the Shadowfell</p></li><li><p>track down the Lich</p></li></ul><p>I ask whether we want this done before or after lunch. We agree that dealing with Matron Vandree is the most urgent, as she will come for Kyrin and me as soon as she can. Plex can move freely again, and Aviana wants her chain back. Plex has the zoomies; he is stress-testing the pathfinding algorhythm, running laps around the tower. That's a lot of magic words! Fearghas shuffles back to the library for more research on the Astral Sea and the castle mentioned by Lady Vandree. No luck, so we discuss how to find the Matron. Kyrin pulls out the House Vandree crest she found at the campsite; it has blood on it, so it would be useful in divination magic to locate its owner.</p><p>The crest is a cloak pin in the shape of crossed daggers. It is not magical. We have no idea how to make use of it.</p><p>We consider going to Heaven, and waiting and seeing whether Matron Vandree comes to get me. Plex suggests going to the Feywild, to Mennon. I ask who Mennon is; Plex casually responds Mennon is an archfey. I squeak at this. Aerelia gets carrot up his nose again. Must be a surge, a major one.</p><p>I get a Sending from Matron Vandree and repeat it to the party:</p><p><em>Little traitor, remember your friend Madr? He had some words for you. \"Did we not take care of you? Protect you? You had to run to your kin of cowering surface-dwellers!\" I might have misheard some parts, his words were difficult to make out between his screams. I'll let you know if he has more to say.</em></p><p>I panic and tell the party that the Matron is torturing my friend, and I will surrender myself to her so I can help Madr. They suggest I send a message to Madr first to try and ascertain the Drows' whereabouts, and if this fails, I will surrender myself. I use one of my scrolls of Sending and message Madr:</p><p><em>Madr, this is Naami. Where are you? Are you okay? I will come free you, whether you want it or not.</em></p><p>He responds:</p><p><em>Naami? Are you ok? The Lady told of your treachery so I'm surprised you're still alive! Stay out of this! Don't come for me!</em></p><p>Fearghas and me discuss whether Matron Vandree could have intercepted my Sending and tampered with it somehow. He doesn't know of any way, and enquires about the nature of Lady Vandree's magic. Shalkoc suggests I message Lady Vandree and claim I've captured a dragon. Somehow the discussion ends up in whether to tie up Shalkoc, which makes Fearghas very frustrated. We discuss where to go and draw the Matron to (or more likely, her minions), and settle on someplace near Lessia.</p><p>Shalkoc whips up some food for us; spicy poultry for Fearghas, spicy chocolate biscuits for me (delicious!), a stack full of meat burger for Kyrin (Fearghas asks where he got the meat from), a herby donut for Emilio (he is very happy), then after Aviana grumbles about Emilio getting a donut, Shalkoc whips up another donut for her. It's covered in dark sauce… it's chocolate sauce, right? Lastly, Shalkoc grills up a fish for himself. Then he realises he forgot to make a snack for Plex, and cooks a green salad with some weird stuff on it. Supposedly it tastes like meat, but it isn't meat? How does he do that…</p><p>Fearghas teleports us to Promise around noon. For Emilio and Kyrin, it's the first time they see the floating island! Fearghas gives them a warm welcome to the island. Kyrin asks how it stays up, and Fearghas explains that the wind crystals are degrading and need research and repairs. Aviana says they are enslaving air elementals. What??</p><p>I use another scroll of Sending to contact Matron Vandree:</p><p><em>Matron, please do not hurt Madr. I will surrender myself. I am on the floating island above Lessia.</em></p><p>(By the way I get a surge and I am unable to read for a week. Very tempted to burn a spell slot to remove that.)</p><p>She responds immediately:</p><p><em>Oh such innocence. During all of your time with us, you still haven't understood, have you? I don't care about where you are and I don't need to. To punish you for your disgression, all I need to know is where those you care about are.</em></p><p>Kyrin and Fearghas guess that Matron Vandree is making me suffer for fun, and eventually she will come to see it with her own eyes. Therefore our best bet is to wait for her cruelty to get the better of her. Oh, joy.</p><p>Plex placed traps around the doors in the cabin while nobody was looking. Oh, further joy.</p><p>Shalkoc's cat-sized dragon Ivernia perches on his shoulder, and Aviana's frost wolf Kaar is hanging around the chicken coop. Aviana asks for food for the dog. That wolf is very hungry, and so is the dragon, and we will need to resupply food soon. Kyrin feeds the dragon some dried meat; somehow she doesn't like it, and spit on Kyrin's face. She's devoured similar food before…</p><p>Kyrin feeds Kaar, and he gives her a thorough lick, drenching her in drool. How friendly!</p><p>We go upstairs so Kyrin and Emilio can pick a room. Plex doesn't remember which doors he has trapped, so he uses a magical key to make more doors. Shalkoc triggers one of the goblin's traps, and he jumps out of the way. Plex says to tell him before opening doors. Fearghas does not tell Plex, opens the door to his room, and triggers a trap. A stone hurtles towards him, whacking him in the head. The stone shouts \"Ow!\" and a light powder explodes in the air, making Fearghas sneeze violently. He also explodes at Plex, telling him to remember where he puts his traps!</p><p>Emilio gives up on this whole bullshit and snuggles up in a bed.</p><p>\"Are you gonna use Plex as a hammer?\" - Aerelia</p><p>Fearghas uses a spellgem of Sending to ask Kali to come to the cabin.</p><p>I ask if I can examine everyone and check for lingering injuries, to make sure we are all in fighting shape. I knock on Emilio's door and he is… not… here? He's woven a cocoon of purple light around him and is just floating in there, eyes glowing. Since when can he do that? I guess I'll ask again later…</p><p>Plex plants magic mushrooms from the Feywild, what could go wrong? I check everyone for injuries but they are all doing fine, it's a relief. Aviana is thankful for my care and I get inspiration!</p><p>Kali arrives and Fearghas casts Comprehend Languages so he can understand her Druidic language. She looks at us with all her 6 red eyes, Kyrin is taken aback. Fearghas asks Kali to go to Lessia and rescue his parents. She is a little doubtful on how to carry out the task. Fearghas asks Kali how much she was paid to kill Aviana. To… KILL… Aviana? So Kali is an assassin, and also a bachelorette apparently.</p><p>Kyrin shapeshifts into her child form, which intrigues Kali (don't blame her). Kali says she was paid 8000 gold to assassinate Aviana, and she only took the contract as a side job. Aviana is offended by the low price on her head, and argues she should be worth at least 10 000 gold. Fearghas grumbles, and offers Kali 5000 gold to rescue his parents. She asks for double. Fearghas barters and rolls a natural 20! Kali says she just wanted to test him, and agrees to the 5000 gold.</p><p>Kali says we can contact her by speaking to any of the spiders here. Spiders understand common? the Drow says they don't understand in the way we can have a conversation, but they will go to her if anything is up. I ask Kali if she would plant the Springseeds for me, and care for them. I show her one of the seeds, she is very intrigued. She says the seeds must have come from a beautiful place. My mind flashes back to the celestial warped into a fiend, and the fight for our lives in the Sibriex lair; I get choked up, unable to get a word out. Kali assumes the place I got the seeds was so beautiful I am at a loss for words. I let her believe that.</p><p>Kali enquires about Kyrin's shapeshifting ability. Kyrin explains it's part of who she is, not something learnt. Kali seems sad about this, and says a lot of people would pay good money to hire her. Kyrin says yes, she was working for the Drow, it did not go well. Kali is very confused at the talk of the egg and the Sibriex lair. I kindly ask that we don't speak of this further. Sarenrae knows, I have plenty of nightmares as it is.</p><p>Kyrin starts chatting with Kali telepathically using Psychic Whispers. Kali also says she can teach us certain spells, given time. She can teach me to speak with the spiders! I definitely want to spend some time with her, not only for the spells, I want to plant my trees! Kali casually mentions that the two easternmost doors are trapped, so Kyrin decides to sleep on the couch, it's safer than trying to open doors.</p><p>Kali invites Kyrin and me to join her on the other side of the island, where it is much quieter (glares at Plex). Aviana wants Kali to teach her many knots, so she can tie up Plex. Kali demonstrates the restraining of short people by spitting spiderweb on Kyrin in child form, and wraps her up in a spider cocoon so she cannot move at all. Aviana is interested, spits on the ground, doesn't seem to work. Kali slices Kyrin free with exceptional dagger skills. We imagine if Kali wanted to hurt Kyrin, Kyrin would have been dead <em>last week</em>.</p><p>Kali can use ZA WARUDO with needles and a Time Stop spell. Aviana knows this, and confidently says Kali would not hurt a fly. I think Kali EATS flies. No offense.</p>"

His life was taken not by the scoundrels he sought to negotiate with, but by an outsider – an adventurer named Aviana. This harpy possesses abilities that border on the fantastical, growing to a colossal size and causing destruction with the ease of a child stomping on a sandcastle. Though the tales may be inflated, one cannot afford to be dismissive of even the slightest possibility. Thelgem was a mighty warrior and this accursed creature has to be to an awesome foe to have slain him.</p><p>Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to track down and eliminate Aviana. She currently resides on the island of Deadlight, in a cabin near the island's sole city, also named Deadlight. Discretion is paramount; while this is a matter of clan honour, it is imperative that the clan's involvement remains concealed as to not taint our diplomatic efforts in the region.</p><p>For your successful execution of this task, you will be compensated handsomely with 10,000 gold coins. Consider it not just a payment, but the settling of a grudge. The Grumblechests do not forget, and we do not forgive such transgressions lightly.</p><p>The terms are simple: Aviana's life in exchange for the reward. </p><p>I await word of your success.</p><p><strong>A Vengeful Benefactor</strong></p><hr><p>P.S. – To give you an edge, enclosed are the last known sketches of Aviana and a map of Deadlight.

The success of this mission is critical, as MacAllistair's creations pose a threat to our strategic interests.</p><p>These orders come directly from our superiors, and while I personally find this decision regrettable, given my own favorable opinion of MacAllistair, the necessity of our empire's security must take precedence. His creations, though admirable, are too dangerous to be left unchecked.</p><p>You are to execute this task with the highest level of discretion and caution. The implications of our involvement becoming known could severely damage the diplomatic relations between the Taldorian Empire and the nation of Deadlight. Failure to maintain secrecy is not an option.</p><p>I trust you resolve this matter swiftly and silently.

His greatest treasure was a grimoire, a book so filled with ancient and forbidden magic which he guarded jealously, letting no soul touch it. Except... except for the day he crossed paths with Utgard-Loki.</p><p>Utgard-Loki, as we all know, is no mere giant. He is a wizard of great renown, a trickster whose wit could cut sharper than any sword. He longed for that grimoire, not because he needed its spells—oh no!—but because he wished to prove that no one, not even a lich, could outmatch his cunning.</p><p>And so, Utgard-Loki approached Ul'katir with an offer. \"Mighty lich,\" he said, with a honeyed voice, \"I have heard tell of your grimoire, a tome filled with such power that even the gods might tremble. I would ask only to read it—once—so that I, too, might witness its greatness.\"</p><p>Now Ul'katir, ever wary, narrowed his glowing eyes. \"And what, pray, would you offer me in return for such a privilege?\"</p><p>Utgard-Loki smiled that sly smile of his, the one that made you think he already knew how the game would end. \"I will give you my most valuable tome. Surely, it will be a worthy trade.\"</p><p>The lich pondered this. A most valuable tome, you say? He thought to himself, \"What could the king of giants possess that rivals my power?\" But greed is a trap, and so Ul'katir agreed, though not without a safety net. He enchanted his grimoire, binding it with a spell that would return it to him the very moment Utgard-Loki read even a single word.</p><p>But Utgard-Loki… well, he is not one to play fair. He handed the lich his \"most valuable tome\"—and what was it? Not some ancient spellbook, not some arcane artifact. No, it was the teenage diary of Thor himself, which the trickster had stolen years before!</p><p>(At this, you might laugh, my friends, and you'd be right to! For this was the same Thor who, in his younger years, wrote poems of unrequited love, tales of his embarrassing misadventures, and dreams of one day growing a beard worthy of his hammer!)</p><p>Ul'katir, expecting some great magical work, opened it, only to be greeted by page upon page of Thor’s… rather juvenile musings. The lich, of course, was furious! But before he could act, Utgard-Loki was already gone, his prize grimoire in hand.</p><p>Now, what does our trickster do with this mighty tome? Does he read it? Does he unlock its secrets and claim its power for himself?</p><p>Nay! He takes it back to his hall, places it on his table, and uses it as a coaster for his drinking horn. Yes, my friends, the great grimoire of Ul'katir, the lich’s greatest treasure, became nothing more than a rest for a giant's mead!</p><p>Why, you ask? Because Utgard-Loki knew well the spell laid upon it. He knew the moment he read even a single word, it would vanish, returning to the lich. So instead, he let it sit beneath his horn, never once turning a page, and Ul'katir’s magic was powerless.</p><p>But that's not all! Oh no, the tale is not yet done. For you see, Utgard-Loki went a step further in his cleverness. He sought out Thor, yes, the very god whose diary he had given away. And with a whisper of false sympathy, he said to him:</p><p>\"Thor, my friend, I have terrible news. A foul lich by the name of Ul'katir has your private diary, and he reads it aloud to all who bring him treasures, gems, and scrolls. Tales of your beardless days, your youthful dreams of being a 'great poet'—he spreads it far and wide!\"</p><p>Thor, as you can imagine, flew into a rage like none had seen before. His thunder echoed across the realms, and with a flash of lightning, he set out to find Ul'katir and reclaim his diary. And Ul'katir, who had been so annoyed with his newfound 'tome,' found himself on the receiving end of the Thunder God's fury.</p><p>By the end of it, the lich had no grimoire, no diary, and a very sore skull from the wrath of Mjolnir.</p><p>And so, my friends, Utgard-Loki tricked not one, but two mighty beings. The lich, who thought himself clever, and Thor, who thought himself wronged by an innocent lich. All without ever casting a spell or lifting a weapon. Such was the cunning of the frost giant king.</p><p>And that, is the story of how the mighty Utgard-Loki made a coaster of a lich's greatest treasure, the grimoire which he proudly uses to this day.</p></blockquote>"

          "content": "<p>Hey, Linzi. So, if you're reading this, you're probably furious and stomping around the tower because you can’t leave until you finish your <em>“basic routine”</em> tasks. You’re probably muttering something about how this is all stupid and unnecessary, and honestly? I get it.</p><p>But before you start tearing apart the enchantments (because let’s be honest, I <em>know</em> you’ve thought about it), I need you to remember why you’ve put them up in the first place.</p><p>You’re a disaster sometimes. Not with magic—you’re good at that, obviously. But everything else? <em>Everything</em> else? You can barely keep it together. You forget to eat. You forget to sleep. You forget to take care of yourself like a normal person. And, yes, it’s embarrassing to admit, but it’s true.</p><p>I mean, look at the plants. How many have you killed so far? And don’t even get me started on the portal you left open a few months ago… What was it? An aboleth, a deva, a horned devil and a very confused goat? You can't keep letting things slide. This is supposed to make sure you stop acting like an incompetent idiot when it comes to the basics.</p><p>Here’s the deal. I enchanted the tower to <em>force</em> you to get your act together. Why? Because we both know you won’t do it unless you have no choice. You’re too good at avoiding it, making excuses, or getting caught up in something else. So, no more excuses. No more letting things pile up until it’s overwhelming. This time, you’re going to handle it.</p><p><strong>What you need to do before you can leave (and no, you can’t skip any of these):</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Take a bath.</strong> With soap! Not just splashing water on your face. (And <em>please </em>remember to put on clothes afterwards. No more accidents. We don’t need another embarrassing incident.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Eat a meal.</strong> A proper one. Not just some random snack. A <em>meal</em>. With veggies. And proteins. And no, potions don’t count as food.</p></li><li><p><strong>Water the plants.</strong> Yes, all of them. Especially the one in the study is practically <em>begging</em> for help. You’re the reason it looks like that.</p></li><li><p><strong>Close any portals you’ve opened.</strong> Seriously. You don’t want even more stray creature messing up the tower again. On that note, I still haven't found the dust devil that snuck through last week…</p></li><li><p><strong>Keep the tower tidy.</strong> All of it! I know, you hate it. But do it anyway. It’s about having a clear mind and a space where you can actually find things! Dust and clutter distract you, and you know it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Finish your experiments.</strong> No more half-finished nonsense blowing up in your face because you walked away for “just a minute.” Complete what you start or don’t start at all.</p></li><li><p><strong>Feed your prisoners.</strong> If you went through the effort of imprisoning someone, you should at least keep them alive along enough to get whatever information you wanted out of them. So <em>don’t forget about them</em> like last time. I sure hope I learned from that and you better not prove me wrong.</p></li><li><p><strong>Keep the artifact vault locked.</strong> If I have to thaw out the entire tower because you forgot to secure that artifact again, I swear I will scream.</p></li></ul><p>I know you’re going to hate this, but it’s necessary. If you want to stop feeling like a complete mess every time you finally come up for air, you need to fix these things. And yeah, I know part of you is reading this and thinking “but I’m too busy” or “I don’t have time for this,” but you <em>do</em> have time. You’re just choosing to ignore it. And that’s what got us here.</p><p>So suck it up, do the tasks, and maybe—<em>just maybe</em>—you’ll start feeling less like a walking disaster and more like… well, I don’t know. Someone who has their life together, at least a little.</p><p>Hopefully enchanting the tower and locking you inside will finally force yourself into actually being a functional adult. You're too powerful to be this messy and disorganized.</p><p>With love (and frustration), <em>Yourself</em></p><p>P.S. I swear if you undo the spell, I’ll re-cast it twice as strong.</p>"

          "content": "<blockquote><p>Azgaraz was a dwarven hold infamous for their 'acceptance' of magic and famous for being skilled monster hunters. Once upon a time their crown prince journeyed to Jotunheim with a large expedition to slay one of the legendary Jormungandr (Ice Wurms/Snakes) there.</p><p>While making camp, two of the dwarves went for a walk where they encountered a frost giant child. </p><p>The three talked and when the dwarves told the child that they were looking for a Jormungandr, the child told the dwarves of a place it had once seen one. It also told the dwarves story of a frost giant who once killed a Jormungandr, only to be slain by his own kin shortly afterwards and explained that Jormungandr were sacred to frost giants.</p><p>When the two dwarves headed back to their expedition, they were in two minds about the information they had just learned. One was exciting for having been told where they could find such a beast, while the other was concerned about the tale they'd been told and worried that a similar fate could await them.</p><p>When they returned, they spoke with the crown prince who didn't take the dwarf who voiced his concerns seriously, mocking him in front of the entire expedition and calling him a superstitious coward. The dwarves continued their journey and in the weeks it took them to find the place the child had told them about, the entire expedition treated the dwarf who had voiced his doubts with distain.</p><p>When the expedition reached the place, not far from Utgard, they found the Jormungandr and prepared for the fight. To add insult to injury, the crown prince forbade the doubting dwarf to take part in the upcoming battle, stating that a battlefield was no place for someone so soft.</p><p>When the battle began, the lone dwarf left behind at camp decided he had enough and went to Utgard to tell the frost giants about their expedition. The frost giants didn't believe him at first, after all why would anyone ever want to kill a Jormungandr, especially someone that short, and sent him away.</p><p>The dwarf returned to the camp and was surprised to see that his expedition had already won the battle and slain the mighty creature. When asked why he had abandoned his duty to guard the camp during the battle and where he had gone, the dwarf lied but it raised suspension anyways. </p><p>The expedition was celebrating their victory, feasting and drinking in a way only dwarves can, and so they didn't notice the small army of frost giants who had come from Utgard to investigate the dwarf's claims until it was far too late. When they arrived and saw the corpse of their sacred creature and the camp of celebrating dwarves, they went mad with rage and attacked. </p><p>Even though the dwarves were taken by surprise, they were all experienced veterans and put up a fierce fight. The crown prince, who had put two and two together, called the doubting dwarf a traitor and slew him before he, as the last dwarf standing, was slain by the frost giant's general soon after. With his dying breath he, in the name of all loyal dwarves under his command, swore revenge upon traitors and frost giants alike. </p><p>Thus only one dwarven soul came to be judged by Pharasma that day, as all but the traitor's still linger on that battlefield, bound by their crown prince's oath of revenge. </p></blockquote>"

They mined deep, uncovering ever richer veins of ore, but eventually Torag came to them and warned them to not dig any deeper. Something profane lay below, he told them, and our ancestors were wise enough to heed our creator's augury without question.</p><p>For some foolish few however, this councel wasn't enough and in their quest to sate their own greed and curiosity, they continued ever deeper, and Torag's heart grew heavy, for he knew they'd soon find what he tried to protect them from. Our ancestors worried for their kin but when the fools returned, our ancestors wept for they realised that they were kin no more. Their skin was burnt and blackened, and their eyes shone like smoldering embers, and when Torag saw this, he came and called them Duergar, and exiled them, for they were his children no longer. The Duergar pleaded for forgiveness but Torag knew their wrong was too great and when he denied them, the Duergar denouced him and crawled down into the deepest reaches of the Underdark, their hearts forever filled with hatred and spite.</p><h3>As told by the Duergar</h3><p>In the days of yore after our Father had chiseled the Dwarves from solid rock in his image, we all flourished under his tutelage.

We mined deep, uncovering ever richer veins of ore, but eventually he came to us and warned us to not dig any deeper. He told us to be afraid. \"Something profane lay below\", was all he spoke, expecting us to do his bidding with a the blind and unquestioning obedience of a child, and many lucky fools did.</p><p>Yet some of us yearned for understanding, striving like any child to one day to become as wise as our beloved Father. And so they forged on and soon found the flame our Father tried to protect us from. It burnt us, charred our skin, and we called it Azgal, the Ebon Fire. We fled in terror back to our Father and brothers, yet upon our return, we were met not with warmth and succor, but with cold contempt and scorn. Confused we pleaded for our Father's forgiveness, but he betrayed us, renounced us, denied us as his children, and called us Duergar. For this is when we finally realised that our beloved Father views us not as children to be raised but as cattle to be kept under a yoke. And our former brothers stood by and watched, their eyes first showing the very look of superiority with which they still look down on us today, for they don't mind being nothing but obedient dogs as long as they get to sit next to our creator's feet.</p>"
