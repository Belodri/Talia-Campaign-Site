Blessed by the divine light of Mount Celestia, they are offered by the angelic hosts of Heaven to those seeking to perform acts of true empathy - often given freely to poor sinners looking for penance.</p><p>The belief that the truest measure of a soul is not in avoiding hardship, but in the willingness to bear the burdens of others, is a belief not just common amongst the denizens of Heaven but also shared by their mortal followers. As such, many monasteries across the realms which are dedicated to lawful good deities or principles, welcome donations of used lockets and display them in quiet galleries where each captured portrait of a moment of sacrifice serves as a silent lesson in courage and compassion for all to witness. Novitiates spend hours in silent contemplation before them, learning not only from dusty tomes, but from the faces of ordinary people captured in their single greatest moment.</p><p><strong>Moment of Martyrdom.</strong> When another creature you can see becomes affected by a curse (or an effect that can be ended or removed via the Remove Curse spell), you can activate the locket (no action required) to take the curse upon yourself instead. This ability cannot be used if the other creature isn't willing or if you are immune to any the curse's effects.</p><p>When the item is activated this way, the locket becomes a nonmagical @UUID[Compendium.talia-custom.customItems.Item.dQQKUD2XEIMNbGXl]{gold locket with a painted portrait inside} (DMG, p134), depicting you in the moment you took the curse upon yourself.</p>",

See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.</p><div></div><div><span> <span>Cantrips.</span></span> <p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p><div></div></div><div><span> <span>Spellbook.</span></span> <p>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p><div></div></div><div><span> <span>Preparing and Casting Spells.</span></span> <p>The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><div></div><p>You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell @spell[magic missile], you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p></div><div><span> <span>Spellcasting Ability.</span></span> <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your wizard spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><div></div><p></p><div><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</div><p></p><p></p><div><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</div><p></p></div><div><span> <span>Ritual Casting.</span></span> <p>You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.</p><div></div></div><div><span> <span>Spellcasting Focus.</span></span> <p>You can use an @item[arcane focus|phb] as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p><div></div></div><div><span> <span>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher.</span></span> <p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see \"Your Spellbook\").</p><div></div></div><div><span><h4>Your Spellbook</h4><span><span>[–]</span></span></span><p>The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p><p>A spellbook doesn't contain cantrips.</p><div><div><span> <span>Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></span> <p>When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p><div></div><p>Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p><p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p><div><span> <span>Copying from a Spell Scroll.</span></span> <p>A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When you copy a spell from a spell scroll, you must succeed on an Intelligence (&amp;Reference[skill=Arcana]) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.</p><div></div></div></div><div></div></div><div><div><span> <span>Replacing the Book.</span></span> <p>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p><div></div><p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p></div><div></div></div><div><div><span> <span>The Book's Appearance.</span></span> <p>Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p><div></div></div><div></div></div><div></div></div></div>",

Any visible effects created by a spell cast through this armor shimmer in many different colors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Flash of the Litr Rune.</strong> If a creature scores a critical hit against you, you can expend 1 charge as a free action to emit a flash of bright light. All creatures within 60 feet of you that can see you must make a [[/save con dc=20 format=long]] or be &amp;Reference[blinded]. Any creature blinded by this effect can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns to end the effect.</p></li><li><p><span><strong>Ward of the Litr Rune.</strong> As an action you can expend 8 charges to activate the Ward of the Litr Rune for 1 minute. While the ward is active, a barrier of translucent panels of many-colored light forms around you, making you resistant to 4 different types of damage and vulnerable to one other. The types of damage you're resistant and vulnerable to are determined randomly when you first receive the effect and at the start of each round in combat.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Gift of the Litr Rune.</strong> A master blacksmith can transfer the armor's magic to another nonmagical plate armor by etching the exact decorations and runes that adorn this armor into the other. The transfer takes 8 hours of uninterrupted work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, this this armor is destroyed and the chosen item gains all properties of this armor.</p></li></ul><p>The wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</p><p>If the wearer has a Strength score lower than 15, their speed is reduced by 10 feet.</p></div>",

A creature might have been imprisoned as a result of defaulting on a deal, while another might be the victim of a night hag's curse.</p><p><strong>Carrying Soul Coins. </strong>To hold a soul coin is to feel the soul bound within it—overcome with rage or fraught with despair. An evil creature can carry as many soul coins as it wishes (up to its maximum weight allowance). A non-evil creature can carry a number of soul coins equal to or less than its Constitution modifier without penalty. A non-evil creature carrying a number of soul coins greater than its Constitution modifier has disadvantage on its attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.</p><p><strong>Freeing a Soul. </strong>Casting a spell that removes a curse on a soul coin frees the soul trapped within it, as does expending all of the coin's charges. The coin itself rusts from within and is destroyed once the soul is released. A freed soul travels to the realm of the god it served or the outer plane most closely tied to its alignment (DM's choice). The souls of lawful evil creatures released from soul coins typically emerge from the River Styx as devils.</p><p><strong>Hellish Currency. </strong>Soul coins are a currency of the Nine Hells and are highly valued by devils. The coins are used among the infernal hierarchy to barter for favours, bribe the unwilling, and reward the faithful for services rendered. Soul coins are created by Mammon and his greater devils on Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells, in a vast chamber where the captured souls of evil mortals are bound into the coins. These coins are then distributed throughout the Nine Hells to be used for goods and services, infernal deals, dark bargains, and bribes.</p><p><strong>Unmake a Soul. </strong>When casting a spell which requires repeated castings for it's effects to become permanent, soul coins can be expended as a material component and the souls trapped inside unmade. Each soul coin expended this way reduces the number of required castings by three. Unmaking a soul is different to freeing it as doing so erases the soul from existence itself, it's essence lost forever.</p>",

Each coin weighs one-third of a pound, and is inscribed with Infernal writing and a spell that magically binds a single soul to the coin. Because each soul coin has a unique soul trapped within it, each has a story. A creature might have been imprisoned as a result of defaulting on a deal, while another might be the victim of a night hag's curse.</p><p><strong>Carrying Soul Coins. </strong>To hold a soul coin is to feel the soul bound within it—overcome with rage or fraught with despair. An evil creature can carry as many soul coins as it wishes (up to its maximum weight allowance). A non-evil creature can carry a number of soul coins equal to or less than its Constitution modifier without penalty. A non-evil creature carrying a number of soul coins greater than its Constitution modifier has disadvantage on its attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.</p><p><strong>Freeing a Soul. </strong>Casting a spell that removes a curse on a soul coin frees the soul trapped within it, as does expending all of the coin's charges. The coin itself rusts from within and is destroyed once the soul is released. A freed soul travels to the realm of the god it served or the outer plane most closely tied to its alignment (DM's choice). The souls of lawful evil creatures released from soul coins typically emerge from the River Styx as devils.</p><p><strong>Hellish Currency. </strong>Soul coins are a currency of the Nine Hells and are highly valued by devils. The coins are used among the infernal hierarchy to barter for favours, bribe the unwilling, and reward the faithful for services rendered. Soul coins are created by Mammon and his greater devils on Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells, in a vast chamber where the captured souls of evil mortals are bound into the coins. These coins are then distributed throughout the Nine Hells to be used for goods and services, infernal deals, dark bargains, and bribes.</p><p><strong>Unmake a Soul. </strong>When casting a spell which requires repeated castings for it's effects to become permanent, soul coins can be expended as a material component and the souls trapped inside unmade. Each soul coin expended this way reduces the number of required castings by three. Unmaking a soul is different to freeing it as doing so erases the soul from existence itself, it's essence lost forever.</p>",

When he sought to share his love of gold and jewels with the dwarves, Torag forbade it, warning that such gifts would only sow greed and strife among them. But Smednir pleaded, swearing a solemn oath that he alone would bear the burden of greed, so that his kin might cherish wealth without being consumed by it.</p><p>Yet as the dwarves flourished, so too did their desires, and Smednir’s burden grew heavier with each passing age. In time, the weight proved too great, and inevitably, he faltered.  For this failure, Torag beheaded him, and the blood that flowed from his severed neck sunk deep into the earth, forming veins of Oathgold.</p><p>To the dwarves, Smednir’s fall is no tale of treachery, but of tragedy. His story serves as both a warning against making promises one cannot keep and a solemn reminder that no oath, once sworn, is without consequence. Even the smallest broken word carries weight, and so it is said that consuming an Oathgold Coin may absolve a minor lapse, easing the burden of guilt in the eyes of the gods.</p><p><strong>Oathbound Exchange</strong></p><p>A creature holding an Oathgold Coin can consume it as a bonus action to immediately end attunement to one magical item and immediately attune to another magical item in its possession.

The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p><div><span> <span>Copying from a Spell Scroll.</span></span> <p>A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When you copy a spell from a spell scroll, you must succeed on an Intelligence (&amp;Reference[skill=Arcana]) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.</p><div></div></div></div><div></div></div><div><div><span> <span>Replacing the Book.</span></span> <p>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p><div></div><p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p></div><div></div></div><div><div><span> <span>The Book's Appearance.</span></span> <p>Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes.

Each coin weighs one-third of a pound, and is inscribed with Infernal writing and a spell that magically binds a single soul to the coin. Because each soul coin has a unique soul trapped within it, each has a story. A creature might have been imprisoned as a result of defaulting on a deal, while another might be the victim of a night hag's curse.</p><p><strong>Carrying Soul Coins. </strong>To hold a soul coin is to feel the soul bound within it—overcome with rage or fraught with despair. An evil creature can carry as many soul coins as it wishes (up to its maximum weight allowance). A non-evil creature can carry a number of soul coins equal to or less than its Constitution modifier without penalty. A non-evil creature carrying a number of soul coins greater than its Constitution modifier has disadvantage on its attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.</p><p><strong>Freeing a Soul. </strong>Casting a spell that removes a curse on a soul coin frees the soul trapped within it, as does expending all of the coin's charges. The coin itself rusts from within and is destroyed once the soul is released. A freed soul travels to the realm of the god it served or the outer plane most closely tied to its alignment (DM's choice). The souls of lawful evil creatures released from soul coins typically emerge from the River Styx as devils.</p><p><strong>Hellish Currency. </strong>Soul coins are a currency of the Nine Hells and are highly valued by devils. The coins are used among the infernal hierarchy to barter for favours, bribe the unwilling, and reward the faithful for services rendered. Soul coins are created by Mammon and his greater devils on Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells, in a vast chamber where the captured souls of evil mortals are bound into the coins. These coins are then distributed throughout the Nine Hells to be used for goods and services, infernal deals, dark bargains, and bribes.</p><p><strong>Unmake a Soul. </strong>When casting a spell which requires repeated castings for it's effects to become permanent, soul coins can be expended as a material component and the souls trapped inside unmade. Each soul coin expended this way reduces the number of required castings by three. Unmaking a soul is different to freeing it as doing so erases the soul from existence itself, it's essence lost forever.</p>",

          "section": "journal-pages",
          "content": "<p>A plane is a vast dimension with various physical traits, such as gravity and chronology, and metaphysical traits, such as alignment and quintessential composition. Each plane in the Great Beyond represents a separate, concurrent, encapsulated universe that exists independently of each other, although most have connections linking them together. The Great Beyond is a term that encompasses all the planes of existence that make up the known multiverse.</p>\n<p>Each plane is effectively a standalone infinite universe, differentiating them from demiplanes, which are finite and measurable. Planes are also often traversable via means of planar travel, while demiplanes are sometimes subject to more restrictive access.</p>\n<p>Planes might be subdivided into layers, each having their own physical properties similar to distinct planes. These layered planes are interconnected through physical connections, gates, or fluid edges. Layers are usually traversed in a specific order most often visualized as a stack, with connections to other external planes occurring on the top or bottom layers. The levels of Hell represent the most prominently known example of layered planes in the Great Beyond.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>The Inner Planes</h1>\n<p>The term Inner Planes refers to the planes created directly from the collision of positive and negative energy. This includes the Ethereal Sea, the Material Plane and its two reflections inside it, and the Elemental Planes surrounding it. The Inner Planes are considered to be of true neutral alignment.</p>\n<h2>The Etherial Sea</h2>\n<p>This transitive plane is created by the collision and subsequent intermingling of the fundamental forces of <strong>Positive Energy</strong> and <strong>Negative Energy</strong>. This collision and intermingling is considered to be the very mechanism behind creation itself, as evidenced by the fact that new souls are only created on the planes wholly contained within the Ethereal Sea - the Material Plane and, to a lesser extent, the Feywild and the Shadowfell.</p>\n<h2>The Material Plane</h2>\n<p>Also known as the <strong>Prime Material</strong>, <strong>Wellspring of Souls</strong>, <strong>Fulcrum of Existence</strong>, or simply as the <strong>mortal world</strong>, this inner plane lies at the very center of the Ethereal Sea, where positive and negative energy are evenly distributed. As such, most souls that ever sprung into existence were born on the material plane.</p>\n<h2>Feywild</h2>\n<p>The Feywild is the material plane's positive twin, barely touched by negative energy. This makes everything on this inner plane much more intense compared to the neutral material plane. Life flourishes, colors are more vibrant, emotions are unrestrained, change is faster and more chaotic. Travellers from the material plane have often described their experiences in the Feywild as \"dreamlike\" but the plane's connection to dreams is still widely debated amongst scholars. While some believe that the soul of a dreaming creature temporarily shifts into the Feywild, others think that it's visitors from this plane that bring dreams with them.</p>\n<h2>Shadowfell</h2>\n<p>The counterpart to the Feywild, this inner plane and twin of the material plane is primarily influenced by negative energy. It's marked by a bleak and gloomy atmosphere that dulls emotions and fades colors to nothing but shades of grey. Death and shadows shroud the plane and the few that visit it and return recount an oppressive feeling of emptiness and depression. Nightmares are also often associated with the Shadowfell, most scholars however think those, just like other dreams, stem from the Feywild.</p>\n<h2>The Elemental Planes</h2>\n<p>The four elemental planes of Water, Air, Fire, and Earth surround and border the Ethereal Sea. They are believed to be formed from the excess of the positive and negative energies flowing into the Ethereal Sea fail to coalesce into mortal souls. Instead this energy floats onto the shore of one of the elemental planes and becomes part of it.</p>\n<p>Elementals, the creatures native to these planes, are not born but rather manifest from the essence of the plane itself and return to it when they die. As such, elementals represent an form of life and death that's wholly different and disconnected from that of souls.</p>\n<p>Each elemental plane is a representation of its element in all the different forms that element can take. The borders between two elemental planes are not clearly defined and it is thus often advised to imagine the elemental planes as one continuous band.</p>\n<p>One notable feature of the Elemental Planes is that their inner border also marks the farthest extent of the Ethereal Sea and thus of travel through the Ethereal Sea.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>The Outer Planes</h1>\n<p>The Outer Planes lie beyond the Elemental Planes, suspended within the boundless Astral Sea. These are layered realms with each layer possessing its own unique characteristics, appearing as distinct worlds stacked one upon the other, interconnected through specific pathways, portals, or shifting borders. Access to inner layers is often restricted or requires specific, often arduous, means of passage, with planar travelers commonly arriving upon the outermost or \"first\" layer of any given plane.</p>\n<p>The Outer Planes are also the dominions of gods and other ascended beings, who carve their own realms from the fabric of these planes. These domains range from modest domains to spanning across multiple entire layers. These domains are reflections of divine will, where the deity's power is near absolute and the rules of reality are based solely to reflect their ideals. </p>\n<p>Fundamentally different from the neutral Inner Planes, the Outer Planes are intrinsically tied to the concepts of alignment, belief, and the ultimate fate of mortal souls. Out of the nine traditional alignments, all but true neutral are embodied by an Outer Plane - their respective moral and ethical philosophies distilled into physical and metaphysical realities. They are often categorized into Upper and Lower Planes based on their alignment on the good/evil axis.</p>\n<h2>The River of Souls &amp; Pharasma’s Judgment</h2>\n<p>The ultimate fate of a mortal soul is intrinsically tied to Pharasma and to the Outer Planes. Little is truly understood of Pharasma herself and her motivations appear singularly focused on the sanctity and preservation of souls. Indeed, she is known to grant divine power only to those who dedicate themselves to protecting mortal souls from destruction.</p>\n<p>Upon death, a mortal's soul is drawn into the River of Souls, a metaphysical current that lies beyond a veil only the souls of perished mortals can cross. Its place within the known cosmology still remains a mystery to scholars. This river culminates at the <strong>Spire of Eternity</strong>, Pharasma's domain. It is here that the soul undergoes judgment, and is sent to its finaly destination. </p>\n<p>Souls judged to be True Neutral are typically exceptions to this journey's end, often being destined for rebirth upon the Material Plane or one of its reflections. However, souls bearing any other alignment are sent to the Outer Plane where the soul will find its kin. Pharasma's judgment is thus understood not as a system of reward or punishment for deeds committed in life, but rather as an impartial assessment of the soul's true belonging.</p>\n<p>Upon reaching their destined planes, souls undergo a profound metamorphosis. They become an integral part of that plane's very essence and are often reshaped or reborn into new forms of existence known as Outsiders. Consequently, each Outer Plane can be viewed as the collective, distilled essence of all mortal souls of its corresponding alignment that have ever existed, a vast reservoir of aligned energy given form.</p>\n<p>These beings, known as Outsiders—a term encompassing entities such as angels, demons, devils, archons, and inevitables, among others—are native inhabitants of their respective planes. They typically retain no specific memory of their previous mortal existence, instead becoming pure embodiments of their plane's alignment. When an Outsider is slain outside its native plane, its essence is not destroyed but is instead drawn back to its home plane, where it will eventually reform, sometimes retaining its personality and memories. The true destruction of an Outsider's soul is widely believed to be possible only if its soul is destroyed upon its native plane of existence.</p>\n<h2>The Upper Planes</h2>\n<h3>Heaven (Lawful Good)</h3>\n<p>Also known as the <strong>Seven Heavens</strong>, this plane goodness shaped by law and justice tempered with mercy. Even though it and each of its layers are infinitely large, it appears to visitors as a gigantic single mountain with a flat summit. \nPlanar travel is only possible from and to the city named Heaven's Shore (also known colloquially as \"Heathen Shore\") on the bottommost layer, Threshold, and Archons and other celestials visitors keep a close eye on visitors to ensure none of the plane's strong laws are broken.</p>\n<h3>Nirvana (Neutral Good)</h3>\n<p>This plane, also sometimes called the <strong>Sanctuary of Enlightenment</strong>, embodies concept of pure good without being overly restricted by law nor dissipated by the randomness of chaos. Its natives are the contemplative and wise celestials, often taking the shape of animals or angels, who guide spirits to enlightenment and unity with the plane and with themselves</p>\n<h3>Elysium (Chaotic Good)</h3>\n<p>Colloquially known as the <strong>Dreamers' Dream</strong>, it represents the ultimate expression of wild freedom and compassion. Home to the wild and freedom loving azata, it is a place of uninhibited love, art, and expression. The beauty of its untouched wilderness is almost overwhelming, ranging from wild forests to foam-peaked seas, to impossibly high mountains, interspersed with hard-to-reach green valleys, the landscape embodying the lovely and peaceful, and the passionate and wild, all at the same time. \nNone of the normal trappings of civilization can be found here; the natives prefer to live in small groups and gather for larger meetings only occasionally. To outsiders, the untamed and dangerous wilds can seem harsh and uninviting, but the initiated understand its true nature: Elysium is a place promoting selfless cooperation combined with self-sufficiency and the complete lack of external authority.</p>\n<h2>The Medial Planes</h2>\n<h3>Mechanus (Lawful Neutral)</h3>\n<p>This Outer Plane, its singular layer also known as <strong>Axis</strong>, is the plane of absolute, perfect, and impersonal order. Some theories hold that its continent-sized gears make up the clockwork of time throughout the cosmos and that time itself would stop if the gears ceased their turning. \nEverything here exists to fit into the greater scheme of things, and each individual's purpose is to fill a role like a gear in a machine. Passion, fantasy, and illusion do not exist, except for what might be brought in by visitors and would not be well received by the Modrons, Inevitables, and Aeons home to this plane.   </p>\n<h3>Limbo (Chaotic Neutral)</h3>\n<p>Collectively referred to as <strong>the Maelstrom</strong>, this plane is supreme chaos, an ever-changing storm of elemental matter, color, thought, and energy. Even though it is easy to shape with nothing but a thought, dampening the chaos down to livable levels and producing a safe environment, it only takes a single moment of distraction for any creations fall apart again.\nDemigods and other powerful beings do not have this burden and can create realms that survive even if they left Limbo. As such, Limbo has become the chosen home of a vast variety of beings not native to the plane. </p>\n<h2>The Lower Planes</h2>\n<h3>Hell (Lawful Evil)</h3>\n<p>The <strong>Nine Hells</strong>, sometimes referred to as <strong>the Pit</strong>, is the ultimate expression of evil order in the Great Beyond. A plane of sinister wickedness and institutional cruelty, the devils native to it are organized into a strict caste system with a very rigid chain of command. As well as \"hellish\", the adjective to describe Hell is \"infernal\". \nAll nine layers of Hell are the domain of Asmodeus, and each one is overseen by one of his lieutenants, the dreaded Archdevils. Planar travel is only possible from and to the topmost layer, <strong>Avernus</strong>, and a traveler must pass through each layer in order to arrive at the next lower one.</p>\n<h3>Hades (Neutral Evil)</h3>\n<p>Also known as <strong>Gehenna</strong> or <strong>Abaddon</strong>, this plane is a wasteland of infinite and apocalyptic proportions and home to the fiends known as <strong>Yugoloths</strong> or <strong>Daemons</strong>. It is dominated by the citadels of the Apocalypse Riders but includes vast stretches of uninhabited wastelands, and smaller holdings of minor warlords and vassals. It lies unnaturally quiet, like a land depopulated by war or plague, and is covered in a cold, black mist. The air feels heavy and rotten, and what little light exists is provided by a strange, sun-like object in permanent eclipse.</p>\n<h3>Abyss (Chaotic Evil)</h3>\n<p>The infinite layers of the Abyss, or <strong>the Outer Rifts</strong> as it's sometimes referred to, are the home of demons and the embodiment of evil unfettered by law. These realms are pockets in which the fabric of the Outer Rifts has slowed its relentless, changing insanity to a near-reality pace. These places are often ruled by a demon lord, either thanks to the lord's own power over the area, or simply because demon lords are attracted to a place to build a fortress and armies. Some Abyssal realms have remained relatively unchanged for aeons and are designated as anchored realms, or anchor realms.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>The Astral Sea</h1>\n<p>This transitive plane is often imagined as an ocean of aether, in which all other known planes of existence are suspended. The Astral can be reached from almost any point on an inner plane, elemental plane, or first layer of any outer plane. \nMost of the Astral Sea is a vast, empty expanse, with swirling clouds of white and gray illuminated by motes of light. Visitors occasionally stumble upon the corpse of a dead god or chunks of matter, broken off from their original plane, drifting forever in the silvery void. \nThe Astral has no gravity but objects do retain their mass so one could throw small items or push off from large objects to move in the weightless environment. The pull of gravity can however be felt on floating objects of sufficient size or where created by a magical field.\nCreatures on the Astral Plane don't age naturally. For this reason, some creatures that live on the Astral Plane establish outposts on other planes, often the Material Plane, so their children can grow to maturity.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>The Void</h1>\n<p>Also called the <strong>Far Realm</strong>, this term refers to whatever lies beyond the largely understood cosmology of the multiverse. Very little is known about the Void, as research into it has driven even gods to madness, and scholars generally do not consider it to be part of the Great Beyond.\nThe only thing that's understood about this plane is that it lies beyond the Astral Sea and it's been theorized that the Astral Sea, and with it all other known planes of existence, are nothing but a bubble within the Void.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Demiplanes and Extradimensional Spaces</h1>\n<p>Sometimes also referred to as <strong>False Planes</strong>, these finite pockets within an infinite true plane (most often the Astral Plane), are extradimensional spaces come into being by a variety of means. Some are created by spells while others are natural folds of reality pinched off from the rest of the multiverse. \nWhile planes are also often traversable via means of planar travel, access to demiplanes is generally much restrictive. Theoretically, a Plane Shift spell can carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required for the tuning fork can be extremely hard to acquire. The Gate spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.</p>\n<hr>"

          "name": "Draconic Aspects and their Kin - A Study",
          "section": "journal-pages",
          "content": "<h1>A Survey of the Draconic Age</h1>\n<p>The history of the Material Plane is marked by epochs of great power and sweeping change, yet none is so foundational to the modern world, nor so tragically truncated, as the <strong>Draconic Age</strong>. This era, which concluded with an abruptness that still confounds historians some four millennia later, was defined by the presence of <strong>Dragons</strong>—beings of immense power who were not merely inhabitants of the world, but are believed to have been an inexorable part of its fundamental nature.</p>\n<p>The end of the Draconic Age was nothing less than absolute. The historical record is starkly clear: in a period of astonishing brevity, the entire species of dragonkind vanished from the plane. This disappearance is immediately preceded in the few surviving chronicles of the time by mentions of a period of immense, plane-wide turmoil, an event known to us only by a single name: <strong>The Convergence</strong>. The exact nature of this cataclysm remains one of the greatest unanswered questions of our time.</p>\n<p>The consequences of this vanishing were swift and catastrophic. The vast and powerful Dragonborn empiresm civilizations built upon draconic patronage and philosophy, crumbled into ruin within a few short centuries, their source of power, guidance, and authority irrevocably severed.</p>\n<p>In the millennia of study since, scholars have sought to understand the nature of the beings who held such sway over the world. Lacking living subjects, research has relied upon the painstaking analysis of ancient texts, archaeological evidence, and the interpretation of the enduring myths. From this vast body of work, a standard analytical framework has emerged. Modern historiography categorizes dragonkind into two broad philosophical kin: the <strong>Chromatic</strong> and the <strong>Metallic</strong>. This division is not believed to be one the dragons used themselves, but rather represents a useful paradigm for understanding their two fundamentally different, and often conflicting, approaches to their role as guardians of the Material Plane.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>The Progenitor Myth</h1>\n<p>The genesis of dragonkind, as understood from the synthesis of numerous ancient records, is inseparable from the very fabric of the Material Plane. It is a tale not of evolutionary ascent or divine creation by an external power, but of a singular, cataclysmic event that fundamentally altered the nature of the world.</p>\n<p>The widely held narrative posits that in a primordial age, the world was governed by two native deities, <strong>Bahamut</strong> and <strong>Tiamat</strong>. Unlike the gods of the Outer Planes, these twin progenitors are believed to have been born of the Material Plane itself, their existence a direct manifestation of its nascent, chaotic energies, not unlike that of the Elemental Planes. Their story is one of antithetical natures locked in an eternal conflict that ultimately culminated in their mutual annihilation. In their final, violent moments, their divine essence, their very blood, is said to have poured forth, mingling and from it, the first ten dragons, the great <strong>Aspects</strong>, arose.</p>\n<p>While this origin story is pieced together from countless sources, from Dragonborn doctrinal texts to carvings on cyclopean ruins, its most eloquent and well-preserved articulation is found in the artifact known as the <strong>Redwind Sands Fragment</strong>. Discovered in the last century, this tablet has become a cornerstone of modern draconic studies. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>From plane's own core, the gods are born,<br>\n  their being shaped, their fate is sworn.</p>\n  <p>Tiamat and Bahamut, twins gods of old,<br>\n  in hatred's grip, their conflict bold.</p>\n  <p>Their clash laid waste, no corner spared,<br>\n  the plane engulfed, a realm ensnared.</p>\n  <p>Their last embrace, their breaths entwined,<br>\n  life sparked anew, from death combined.</p>\n  <p>Hate's demise, a sacred birth,<br>\n  ten Aspects rose, from ashes' worth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The analysis of this fragment has dominated scholarly discourse. The opening stanza, \"From plane's own core, the gods are born,\" is of paramount importance, as it supports the theory of native divinity, separating <strong>Bahamut</strong> and <strong>Tiamat</strong> from the pantheons of the Outer Planes. The term \"twins\" is a subject of ongoing debate. While some literalists maintain it implies a familial bond, the prevailing interpretation views it metaphorically, suggesting they were two equal and opposing forces born of a single origin.</p>\n<p>It is crucial to distinguish the primordial shaping of the world described in the third stanza from the later cataclysm of <strong>The Convergence</strong>. The \"clash laid waste\" is understood not as an event of ending, but of violent creation, the forging of the world as we know it through divine conflict.</p>\n<p>The final couplets are the most philosophically significant. The phrases \"last embrace\" and \"Hate's demise\" are interpreted by most scholars not as an act of reconciliation, but as the moment their conflict reached its only possible conclusion: a perfect, final equilibrium in mutual destruction. From this union of opposites, destruction and creation, order and chaos, good and evil, a \"sacred birth\" occurred. This concept is central to all further study: that every dragon, regardless of its philosophical leaning, carries within it the blended, paradoxical essence of both progenitors.</p>\n<h2>Author's Note: Eyes as Vessels of the Soul</h2>\n<p>A compelling and well-supported body of theory posits that the very eyes of a dragon were not mere sensory organs but vessels for its very soul. It is believed that one eye housed the good-aligned essence of Bahamut, and the other, the evil-aligned essence of Tiamat. Some speculate this created a constant internal dialogue that defined the dragon’s nature.</p>\n<p>This theory is supported by ancient tales of one-eyed dragons, who are invariably depicted as beings of extreme moral alignment. Having lost the counter-balancing perspective, they fall into either unwavering virtue or irredeemable evil.</p>\n<p>A significant debate, however, centers on whether this division was consistent. A prominent school of thought posits that Bahamut's essence was always found in the right eye, and Tiamat's in the left. Proponents point to the curious endurance of certain idioms across nearly all languages—phrases such as \"doing the right thing\" and the \"evil eye\"—as potential cultural remnants of a time when this anatomical reality was known.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>The Chromatic Kin</h1>\n<p>The first of the two great philosophical divisions within modern draconic studies is the paradigm of the Chromatic Kin. This category encompasses the Black, Blue, Green, Red, and White dragons. The unifying thread among these five is a philosophy of guardianship centered on the primal, foundational, and often immutable truths of existence.</p>\n<p>The Chromatic worldview does not concern itself with abstract concepts of societal progress or cultivated ideals. Instead, it holds that the Material Plane is governed by fundamental laws—the reality of physical power, the sanctity of the bloodline, the instinct of the predator, or the core imperative to survive. Their guardianship was one of preserving and enforcing these essential pillars, believing that a world which loses touch with these truths becomes a hollow and fragile artifice, doomed to collapse. Their philosophies are thus expressions of the world as it is, in its most raw and honest form.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Dahak the Black</h2>\n<p>\"Only the strongest survive and prosper, so I must be the strongest of all.\"\n—Dahak’s ideal of&nbsp;<strong>Might</strong>,&nbsp;<em>modern interpretation</em></p>\n<p>For Dahak, it is believed that might was not an abstract concept but the singular, organizing principle of reality. He saw himself as the ultimate embodiment of this truth, a living standard against which all other power could be measured. In his view, a world where the weak were allowed to persist was a world courting disaster. His role as a guardian was therefore to be the ultimate challenger, a constant and unyielding force that would shatter not only external foes but also any power structure not founded on true, demonstrable strength.</p>\n<p>The historical impact of this ideal is one of stark duality. On one hand, certain chronicles praise Black Dragons as agents of necessary change, crediting them with shattering corrupt, decaying empires and clearing the way for more vigorous civilizations to rise from the ashes. On the other hand, different records detail the enslavement of entire regions under the heel of a tyrant, where the ideal of might was interpreted as a simple right to dominate. This demonstrates how the same core philosophy could be the source of both violent renewal and brutal oppression.</p>\n<h2>Ishtar the Blue</h2>\n<p>\"The first cracks in a breaking world are severed ties of blood and it is our duty to prevent and mend them.\"\n—Ishtar’s ideal of&nbsp;<strong>Family</strong>,&nbsp;<em>modern interpretation</em></p>\n<p>Ishtar, it is believed, saw the integrity of the bloodline not as a social construct but as a cosmic law. For her, kinship was the sacred, fundamental architecture of reality. Her guardianship was that of a divine matriarch, ensuring the continuation of lineages and the sanctity of ancestral oaths. She viewed a broken dynasty or a forgotten ancestry as a wound upon the world itself, one which she was divinely obligated to prevent or cauterize, preserving the continuity that allowed life and culture to persist through the ages.</p>\n<p>Numerous Dragonborn dynasties chronicled long periods of stability and prosperity, attributing them to the judicious oversight of a Blue Dragon patron who enforced succession and sacred covenants. Conversely, the histories of other realms cite this very ideal as the philosophical basis for periods of intense xenophobia and the creation of rigid, oppressive caste systems. It is clear that the interpretation of \"family\" could lead to either the steadfast foundation of a society or the construction of an inescapable prison of birthright.</p>\n<h2>Azag the Green</h2>\n<p>\"Destroying your foes without exposing yourself to danger is an art.\"\n—Azag’s ideal of&nbsp;<strong>Cunning</strong>,&nbsp;<em>modern interpretation</em></p>\n<p>It is held that for Azag, cunning was the highest expression of a primal truth: that the mind is the ultimate weapon. He viewed direct confrontation not as brave, but as a failure of intellect. His philosophy of guardianship was that of the master predator, one who never engaged in a fair fight. To him, the world was a complex web of motivations and secrets, and true protection came from subtly manipulating that web; turning enemies against one another, unraveling plots from the shadows, and achieving victory so completely that the vanquished never even knew they were at war.</p>\n<p>The consequences of this philosophy were dictated by the individual dragon's ultimate aim. In some fragmented histories, Green Dragons are revered as unseen guardians who averted wars and toppled conspiracies through masterful intrigue. Yet other accounts describe kingdoms descending into ruinous civil strife, the origins of which are traced to the intricate meddling of a Green Dragon who pursued cunning as an art for its own sake, without a clear protective goal.</p>\n<h2>Girra the Red</h2>\n<p>\"Fire destroys, but it can also temper when it is applied carefully—if the material tested is strong enough.\"\n—Girra’s ideal of&nbsp;<strong>Responsibility</strong>,&nbsp;<em>modern interpretation</em></p>\n<p>For Girra, the immense power of fire was not a tool to be used, but a fundamental reality to be managed. Her philosophy was born from the conviction that only a being of supreme self-control and wisdom could be entrusted with such force. Her role as a guardian was to be the ultimate steward of power. The accumulation of legendary hoards, therefore, is understood not as an act of greed, but as the sequestration of power, taking it from the hands of the \"irresponsible\" to be kept under her judicious watch.</p>\n<p>The interpretation of this ideal led to the most dramatic of outcomes. Epic poems celebrate Red Dragons who acted as catalysts for greatness, their fiery trials forging heroes and testing the resolve of nations. In these stories, destruction was a tool for tempering. In stark contrast, historical annals document reigns of terror where \"Responsibility\" was interpreted as a mandate for absolute dominion. These accounts describe cities annihilated for the slightest defiance, illustrating how the philosophy of stewardship could be twisted into a justification for unquestionable and devastating tyranny.</p>\n<h2>Arali the White</h2>\n<p>\"The universe is harsh and unforgiving, and so am I. I do whatever it takes to survive.\"\n—Arali’s ideal of&nbsp;<strong>Survival</strong>,&nbsp;<em>modern interpretation</em></p>\n<p>Arali, it is theorized, perceived all other philosophies as dangerous delusions built upon a single, non-negotiable truth: existence. For her, survival was the only law that could not be broken. Her guardianship was to be the living embodiment of this law - a constant, chilling reminder of the universe's fundamental indifference. By embodying a pure, cold pragmatism, she was thought to prevent the world from growing too decadent and too far removed from the essential, brutal reality of the struggle to endure.</p>\n<p>The application of this stark ideal is a subject of profound scholarly debate. One school of thought posits that the actions of White Dragons, while locally devastating, had a larger ecological or even cosmic purpose, acting as a force of planetary triage that culled the weak to ensure the long-term viability of the whole. A second, equally supported view holds that the ideal was interpreted on a purely individual level. In these accounts, the White Dragon is not a malevolent entity, but a supremely pragmatic predator, whose actions were not driven by cruelty but by a focused and absolute adherence to the law of its own preservation, regardless of the consequences for others.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>The Metallic Kin</h1>\n<p>The second great division within draconic studies is the paradigm of the Metallic Kin, a category encompassing the Brass, Bronze, Copper, Gold, and Silver dragons. The philosophies uniting this group stand in conceptual opposition to their Chromatic counterparts. Where the Chromatics focused on the immutable, primal truths of the world, the Metallics concerned themselves with cultivated ideals—the intellectual and moral concepts that elevate civilization above mere existence.</p>\n<p>The Metallic worldview holds that the Material Plane's true strength lies not in its raw state, but in its potential for growth, learning, and betterment. Their ideals of guardianship are thus centered on constructive principles: the gathering of perspectives, the fostering of progress, the creation of beauty, the application of foresight, and the guidance of leadership. Theirs was a philosophy of nurture, of shaping the world not by enforcing what it is, but by striving to guide it toward what it could be.</p>\n<h2>Nabu the Brass</h2>\n<p>\"Everyone sees things differently, so if you want to know about the world, gather as many different points of view as you can.\"\n—Nabu’s ideal of&nbsp;<strong>Perspective</strong>,&nbsp;<em>modern interpretation</em></p>\n<p>For Nabu, it is believed, ignorance was the greatest threat to the world. He saw conflict, hatred, and prejudice as symptoms of a singular disease: a failure to see the world from another's point of view. His guardianship was that of a master archivist and diplomat. His philosophy dictated that true understanding, and therefore true peace, could only be achieved by collecting and considering the vast multitude of truths held by all creatures. To preserve a story, to facilitate a conversation, was to build a defense against the darkness of misunderstanding.</p>\n<p>The legacy of this ideal is one of profound knowledge, though its utility is debated. In many accounts, Brass Dragons are credited with the founding of great libraries and the brokering of seemingly impossible peace accords between ancient enemies, their actions fostering eras of enlightenment and cooperation. However, other records criticize this philosophy for its potential to lead to moral paralysis. In these cases, a Brass Dragon's obsession with gathering all perspectives is thought to have led to inaction in the face of clear injustice, with the dragon choosing to document an atrocity from all sides rather than intervening to stop it.</p>\n<h2>Erra the Bronze</h2>\n<p>\"Conflict drives evolution. Ever has the spark of war ignited the fires of advancement.\"\n—Erra’s ideal of&nbsp;<strong>Progress</strong>,&nbsp;<em>modern interpretation</em></p>\n<p>Erra, it is thought, viewed peace not as a final goal, but as a dangerous state of stagnation. For her, the universe was defined by change and adaptation, and the primary catalyst for such growth was conflict. Her philosophy of guardianship was not to prevent war, but to ensure it was meaningful. She believed that struggle, whether on the battlefield or in the forge, was the crucible in which new technologies, new strategies, and stronger societies were created. A world without conflict was a world that had ceased to evolve.</p>\n<p>The impact of this philosophy was both creative and destructive. On one hand, Bronze Dragons are celebrated in many military histories as patrons of righteous wars and heroic innovation. They are said to have armed besieged kingdoms and taught brilliant strategies, their intervention turning a desperate defense into a catalyst for an entire generation of technological and societal advancement. Conversely, there are darker suggestions that some Bronze Dragons, seeing a region as too peaceful and soft, would covertly instigate conflict to spur \"progress,\" becoming merchants of war who valued advancement over the lives lost to achieve it.</p>\n<h2>Kabta the Copper</h2>\n<p>\"The ability to create, appreciate, and sustain beauty is the true measure of a creature or civilization.\"\n—Kabta’s ideal of&nbsp;Beauty**,&nbsp;<em>modern interpretation</em></p>\n<p>For Kabta, it is held, a world without beauty was a world not worth guarding. Her philosophy posited that survival was merely the foundation, not the purpose, of life. The true measure of any society's worth was its capacity to create and appreciate beauty, be it in art, music, nature, or even elegant humor. Her guardianship was that of a divine muse and conservator. To inspire an artist, protect a pristine wilderness, or bring laughter to the desperate was to defend the very soul of the world against the encroaching gloom of nihilism and despair.</p>\n<p>This ideal's manifestations varied greatly in their consequences. In numerous chronicles, Copper Dragons are revered as patrons of the arts, their influence sparking cultural renaissances and their fierceness protecting natural wonders from destruction. They were champions of joy and creativity. Yet, other accounts describe a darker side to this aestheticism. These tales speak of master artisans held in gilded captivity to create art for a dragon's private hoard, or of entire villages being \"removed\" for being an \"eyesore\" upon a landscape. </p>\n<h2>Shamash the Gold</h2>\n<p>\"To ensure the cure isn't worse than the disease, one must weigh the consequences of all potential actions.\"\n—Shamash’s ideal of&nbsp;<strong>Foresight</strong>,&nbsp;<em>modern interpretation</em></p>\n<p>Shamash, it is believed, saw rash action as the greatest danger to a stable world. His entire philosophy was built upon a profound understanding of cause and effect. For him, a well-intentioned act with disastrous, unforeseen consequences was no better than a malicious one. His guardianship was one of immense patience and deep calculation. It involved studying the currents of fate and possibility, and acting only when he could be reasonably certain that the intervention would create a better future, even if that future was centuries away.</p>\n<p>In many cases, the influence of a Gold Dragon is thought to have been one of subtle, preventative success, such as a monarch advised against a disastrous war. Their triumphs were often invisible, marked by disasters that never came to pass. The alternative, however, was a form of \"benevolent\" tyranny. Some accounts suggest Gold Dragons, certain of their foresight, would manipulate societies and remove individuals they deemed future threats, stripping mortals of their free will in the name of a better future that only the dragon could see.</p>\n<h2>Shakkar the Silver</h2>\n<p>\"The younger races are capable of great things—sometimes they just need a subtle push in the right direction to find their way.\"\n—Shakkar’s ideal of&nbsp;<strong>Leadership</strong>,&nbsp;<em>modern interpretation</em></p>\n<p>For Shakkar, the mortal races were the world's greatest asset, filled with boundless potential for good. He saw them, however, as tragically short-sighted and prone to error. His philosophy of guardianship was that of a paternal mentor. His role was not to rule mortals, but to guide them, to offer the subtle push, the piece of wisdom, or the anonymous aid that would allow them to achieve their best selves and build just, prosperous societies on their own terms.</p>\n<p>The legacy of this ideal is one of intimate involvement with mortal affairs. Histories of the most just and enlightened kingdoms frequently mention a mysterious, wise benefactor or a strangely knowledgeable advisor, figures often believed to have been Silver Dragons in disguise. Yet, this very closeness held the potential for a suffocating paternalism. In some cases, the subtle guidance is thought to have become overt manipulation, with the dragon treating kings and heroes like puppets. In these instances, the desire to protect mortals from their own mistakes resulted in denying them their agency, suffocating them under a blanket of well-intentioned control.</p>"

          "content": "<p>As commonly understood, souls are created in the Ethereal Sea from the collision of positive and negative energies. These newly created souls, which are yet to find a vessel to manifest in, are called unformed souls - in contrast, souls that have completed this manifestation are known as formed or manifested souls.</p><h2>Ley Lines</h2><p>Soon after a soul springs into existence within the roiling Ethereal Sea, it is picked up by a current. These currents, also known as Ley Lines, carry souls from the depths of the Ethereal Sea to the Material Plane.</p><p>There they wind through the fabric of the plane, branching off smaller ley lines along the way - not unlike a river and its tributaries if the flow was reversed - as the souls they carry seep into the plane.</p><p>Eventually, the ley lines pass through the Material Plane, usually still carrying unformed souls that haven't yet found a vessel, and pour into either the Feywild or the Shadowfell, where souls are dispersed the same way.</p><p>Ultimately, the ley lines empty back into the Ethereal Sea, where any remaining unformed souls briefly drift and mingle with newly created ones before inevitably being drawn into a new cycle by another current.</p><h2>Manifestation</h2><p>At some point along the way, an unformed soul might find an unborn (or unhatched) mortal vessel. The unformed soul then enters the vessel and becomes a formed soul - a process known as Manifestation which marks a moment of significant transformation for the soul.</p><p>It is highly likely that the moment an unformed soul enters its vessel is also the first time it encounters formed souls - namely those of the vessel's parents. This encounter leaves a strong imprint on the unformed soul, causing it to take on a number of characteristics of both parents' souls.</p><p>This explains why children inherit various physical and mental traits of both parents and why the children of, for example, two halflings will (almost) always be halflings as well.</p><p><em>Author's Note: It is not yet understood why this inheritance of traits occurs even in creatures thought not to possess souls, such as beasts.</em></p><h3>Colored by Emotion</h3><p>It is thought that a unformed souls pick up on and are 'colored' by the emotions - or lack thereof - of living creatures they pass by along their way through the ley lines. This explains why siblings and even twins generally display differences in personality.</p><p>One theory even posits that this process could explain the large natural differences between mortals from the three inner planes. It postulates that souls which manifest in the Feywild are those that have been heavily colored by strong emotions while souls manifesting in the Shadowfell are those that picked up either few emotions or an overwhelming amount of apathy or disinterest along their way.</p><h2>Impressions of Death</h2><p>It is well known that ley lines can intersect the River of Souls. Because of this, it is thought that when an unformed soul within such a ley line passes through such an intersection, it might encounter the soul of a recently deceased mortal that's carried by the river.</p><p>This would be the unformed soul's first encounter with a formed soul, and is thus leaves a strong impression upon the unformed soul, similar to what happens during manifestation. As such, the unformed soul takes on some of the encountered soul's characteristics - which could explain many reports of reincarnation where magical influence was ruled out.</p><p>Such an encounter could however also cause the unformed soul to become tainted with the presence of death. When such a tained soul then finds a vessel and manifests, this presence of death begins to affect the unborn vessel and in some cases even the expecting mother. This unfortunate process is understood to be the reason for stillbirths.</p><h3>Natural Undead</h3><p>Undead are commonly viewed as either soulless husks puppeteered by necromantic magic or souls of the deceased that are unable - or unwilling - to enter the river of souls.</p><p>Like many other wide-spread beliefs, this one is mostly accurate but fails to paint the full picture as there is another kind of undead which are very rare on the material plane - and unheard of in the Feywild -, but not all that uncommon in the Shadowfell.</p><p>Unformed souls can become so heavily tainted by the presence of death that they might mistake a corpse for a vessel. The likelyhood for this confusion to occur is thought to be directly correlated with the corpse's similarity to the physical form of the deceased soul that caused the taint. However there are theories that posit that the corpse's similarity to the memory of a loved one of the deceased soul might be a sufficient medium as well.</p><p>An unformed soul that is so heavily tainted might also be able to spontaneously manifest without a vessel. In this case, it would appear as a wandering spirit resembling the deceased soul or the memory of one of its loved ones.</p><p>Either way, because these souls manifest directly into undeath and never experienced life, they don't feel the pull of the River of Souls until their undead vessel or the wandering spirit they appear as are destroyed for the first time.</p><p>As such, there is a growing number of scholars arguing that these \"natural\" undead should be thought of as simply another form of mortals. Some fringe groups even go as far as to argue they should be considered as \"alive\" and prefer to call them \"living dead\" instead of \"undead\".</p>"

These tasks can include buying or creating magic items, pulling off crimes, researching information, or working at a job.</p><p>These activities are handled away from the table, in between game sessions. At the end of a session, the characters can collectively decide to spend one or more weeks on downtime activities. A character then selects a downtime activity from among those available to them from the list below.</p><h3>Resolving Activities</h3><p>Each downtime activity requires a week to resolve, during which a character spends at least 8 hours of each day engaged with the activity.</p><p>Most activities require only a single completion to yield their results. Some longer tasks however may require multiple completions over the course of multiple weeks of downtime. These don't need to be consecutive as each one counts as a separate activity.</p><hr><h1>Downtime Activities - Earning Money</h1><h2>Artistic Endeavours</h2><p>Many people are willing to pay vast sums for high-quality entertainment. You can create a painting for an art gallery, play music at a tavern, or act in plays.</p><h5>Resources</h5><p>An artistic endeavour requires the necessary tools for the chosen endeavour - an instrument to play music, painter's tools to create a painting, a disguise kit to act in plays, etc.</p><h5>Resolution</h5><p>This activity involves a series of skill checks as you work your way up through venues of increasing prestige. You can choose which skill checks you want to make when you choose this activity. The same two checks must be used for all venues.</p><ul><li><strong>Check 1.</strong> Dexterity (Acrobatics), Dexterity (Sleight of Hand), Charisma (Persuasion), or Charisma (Performance)</li><li><strong>Check 2.</strong> Instrument (Cha), Artisan's Tools (Dex/Int/Wis/Cha), or Disguise Kit (Cha/Dex)</li></ul><p>The DC of each venue needs to be beaten by at least one of two skill checks to advance to the next venue. You earn the Gold Reward of that venue if you succeed both skill checks, or half as much if you succeed only one.

The people one comes into contact with can certainly prove useful as well.</p><h5>Resources</h5><p>Carousing covers a week of fine food, strong drink, and socializing. A character can attempt to carouse among lower-, middle-, or upper-class folk. A character can carouse with the lower class for 10 gp to cover expenses, or 50 gp for the middle class. Carousing with the upper class requires 250 gp for the week and access to the local nobility.</p><p>A character with the noble background can mingle with the upper class, but other characters can do so only if you judge that the character has made sufficient contacts. Alternatively, a character might use a disguise kit and the Deception skill to pass as a noble visiting from a distant city.</p><h5>Resolution</h5><p>When choosing this activity, a character must select the social class they want to carouse amongst.</p><ul><li><strong>Lower-class</strong> contacts include criminals, laborers, mercenaries, the town guard, and any other folk who normally frequent the cheapest taverns in town.</li><li><strong>Middle-class</strong> contacts include guild members, spellcasters, town officials, and other folk who frequent well-kept establishments.</li><li><strong>Upper-class</strong> contacts are nobles and their personal servants. Carousing with such folk covers formal banquets, state dinners, and the like.</li></ul><p><strong>Specific Targets.</strong> Additionally, a character may wish to come into contact with a certain group or even a specific individual from among the chosen social class. They might want to make friends with a specific noble that has the king's ear, find a benefactor in a wealthy merchant, get to know the town guards to learn about their patrolling schedules, or make aquiantance with the architect that knows the castle like no other. When choosing a specific target it, it is recommended for a player to also inform the GM about their reason and motives for choosing said target in order to avoid misunderstandings and give the GM more to work with.</p><p>After a workweek of carousing, a character stands to make contacts within the selected social class, and potentially with the selected target. The character makes a Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion) check using the table below.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Check Total</th><th>Result</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>&lt;10</td><td>Character has made a hostile contact.</td></tr><tr><td>10—19</td><td>Character has made no new contacts.</td></tr><tr><td>20—29</td><td>Character has made an allied contact.</td></tr><tr><td>30—39</td><td>Character has made two allied contacts.</td></tr><tr><td>40+</td><td>Character has made three allied contacts.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Contacts are specific NPCs who now share a bond with the character. Each one either owes the character a favor or has some reason to bear a grudge. A hostile contact works against the character, placing obstacles but stopping short of committing a crime or a violent act. Allied contacts are friends who will render aid to the character, but not at the risk of their lives.</p><p>Once a contact has helped or hindered a character, the character needs to carouse again to get back into the NPC's good graces. A contact provides help once, not help for life. The contact remains friendly, which can influence roleplaying and how the characters interact with them, but doesn't come with a guarantee of help.</p><hr><h2>Copying Spells into a Spellbook</h2><h5>Resources</h5><p>One or more spell scrolls to copy into the spellbook and an amount of gold equal to 50 x spell level for each scroll to copy to buy the rare inks required.</p><h5>Resolution</h5><p>A character who chooses this activity must make an ability check using their spellcasting ability and add their proficiency bonus to determine the maximum number of spells the character can copy that week. The character can copy a number of spells whose combined spell level is no more than the rolled total. Only spells on spell scrolls can be copied into a spellbook. A character that has the Ritual Caster feature or has the Book of Ancient Secrets invocation can also copy ritual spells into their ritual books, following the same rules.</p><p>Copying a spell from a scroll into a spellbook destroys the scroll.</p><hr><h2>Crafting an Item</h2><p>A character who has the time, the money, and the needed tools can use downtime to craft armor, weapons, clothing, or other kinds of nonmagical gear.</p><h5>Resources</h5><p>A character must have the appropriate tool and be proficient with its use. Additionally, the character needs raw materials worth half the item's selling cost.</p><h5>Resolution</h5><p>A character crafting an item must make check with the appropriate Artisan Tools (Str/Dex/Int/Wis) check. The result of that check determines the total amount of work the character can get done in that week. A character can craft a number of items with a combined work requirement that is equal to or lower than the number rolled. To determine how much work an item takes to be crafted, divide its gold piece cost by 50.</p><p>If an item would take more work than a character can do in a single week, the character can choose to spend the week working on that item alone, leaving it unfinished. When the character chooses the Crafting an Item activity in the future, they can choose to continue work on the unfinished item. This process can be repeated any number of times until the item is finished. A character cannot have more than one unfinished item at any given time.</p><hr><h2>Relaxation</h2><p>Sometimes the best thing to do between adventures is relax. Whether a character wants a hard-earned vacation or needs to recover from injuries, relaxation is the ideal option for adventurers who need a break. This option is also ideal for players who don't want to make use of the downtime system.</p><h5>Resources</h5><p>A character needs to maintain at least a modest lifestyle while relaxing to gain the benefit of the activity.</p><h5>Resolution</h5><p>Characters who maintain at least a modest lifestyle while relaxing gain several benefits. While relaxing, a character gains advantage on saving throws to recover from long-acting diseases and poisons. In addition, at the end of the week, a character gains the following benefits:</p><ul><li>End one effect that keeps the character from regaining hit points or restore one ability score that has been reduced to less than its normal value. This benefit cannot be used if the harmful effect was caused by a spell or some other magical effect with an ongoing duration.</li><li>Remove up to 3 levels of exhaustion.</li><li>Gain temporary hit points equal to twice the character's level.</li></ul><hr><h2>Religious Service</h2><p>Characters with a religious bent might want to spend downtime in service to a temple, either by attending rites or by proselytizing in the community. Someone who undertakes this activity has a chance of winning the favor of the temple's leaders.</p><h5>Resources</h5><p>Performing religious service requires access to, and often attendance at, a temple whose beliefs and ethos align with the character's. If such a place is available, the activity takes one week of time but involves no gold piece expenditure.</p><h5>Resolution</h5><p>At the end of the required time, the character chooses to make either an Intelligence (Religion) check or a Charisma (Persuasion) check. The total of the check determines the benefits of service, as shown on the Religious Service table.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Check Total</th><th>Result</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>&lt;10</td><td>You gain one disfavor.</td></tr><tr><td>10—19</td><td>No effect. Your efforts fail to make a lasting impression.</td></tr><tr><td>20—29</td><td>You earn one favor.</td></tr><tr><td>30+</td><td>You two favors.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>You can never have a favor and a disfavor a the same time - if you would gain a disfavor while you have a favor, you lose the favor instead. The same holds true vice-versa.</p><p><strong>Favor.</strong> A favor, in broad terms, is a promise of future assistance from a representative of the temple. It can be expended to ask the temple for help in dealing with a specific problem, for general political or social support, or to reduce the cost of cleric spellcasting by 50 percent. A favor could also take the form of a deity's intervention, such as an omen, a vision, or a minor miracle provided at a key moment. This latter sort of favor is expended by the DM, who also determines its nature.</p><p>Favors earned need not be expended immediately, but only a certain number can be stored up. A character can have a maximum number of unused favors equal to 1 + the character's Charisma modifier (minimum of one unused favor).</p><p><strong>Disfavor.</strong> A disfavor works in the contrary to a favor and it is up to the DM to expend it at an appropriate moment and determine its nature. You can choose to make a donation to the temple to rid yourself of any disfavors you have. This donation must have a value in gold pieces equal to 100 x your level x your disfavors.</p><hr><h2>Research</h2><p>Forewarned is forearmed. The research downtime activity allows a character to delve into lore concerning a monster, a location, a magic item, or some other particular topic.</p><h5>Resources</h5><p>Typically, a character needs access to a library or a sage to conduct research. Assuming such access is available, conducting research requires at least 100 gp spent on materials, bribes, gifts, and other expenses.</p><h5>Resolution</h5><p>The character declares the focus of the research—a specific person, place, or thing. After one week, the character makes an Intelligence (Arcana), Intelligence (History), Intelligence (Religion), or Intelligence (Nature) check as chosen by the GM depending on the focus of the research. This check gains a +1 bonus per 100 gp spent beyond the initial 100 gp, to a maximum of +5. In addition, a character who has access to a particularly well-stocked library or knowledgeable sages gains advantage on this check.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Check Total</th><th>Outcome</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>&lt;10</td><td>You learn two pieces of lore, at least one of which is untrue or misleading.</td></tr><tr><td>10—19</td><td>No effect.</td></tr><tr><td>20—29</td><td>You learn one piece of lore.</td></tr><tr><td>30—39</td><td>You learn two pieces of lore.</td></tr><tr><td>40+</td><td>You learn three pieces of lore.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Each piece of lore is the equivalent of one true statement about a person, place, or thing. Examples include knowledge of a creature's resistances, the password needed to enter a sealed dungeon level, the spells commonly prepared by an order of wizards, and so on.</p><hr><h2>Selling a Magic Item</h2><p>Selling a magic item is by no means an easy task. Con artists and thieves are always looking out for an easy score, and there's no guarantee that a character will receive a good offer even if a legitimate buyer is found.</p><h5>Resources</h5><p>A character can find a buyer for one magic item by spending 25 gp to spread word of the desired sale. A character must pick one item at a time to sell.</p><h5>Resolution</h5><p>A character who wants to sell an item must make a Charisma (Persuasion) check against a DC that depends on the item's rarity to determine what kind of offer comes in. The character can always opt not to sell, instead forfeiting the effort and trying again later.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Rarity</th><th>DC</th><th>Base Price (Halved for Consumables)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Common</strong></td><td>10</td><td>(1d6 + 1) x 10 gp</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Uncommon</strong></td><td>15</td><td>1d6 x 100 gp</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Rare</strong></td><td>20</td><td>2d10 x 1000 gp</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Very Rare</strong></td><td>25</td><td>(1d4 + 1) x 10000 gp</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Legendary</strong></td><td>30</td><td>2d6 x 25000 gp</td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th>Check Total</th><th>Offer</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>&lt;DC</td><td>50% of base price</td></tr><tr><td>DC—(DC+9)</td><td>100% of base price</td></tr><tr><td>(DC + 10)+</td><td>150% of base price</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h2>Training</h2><p>Given enough free time and the services of an instructor, a character can learn a language or pick up proficiency with a tool, vehicle, or a single type of weapon.</p><h5>Resources &amp; Resolution</h5><p>Receiving training in a language, tool, vehicle, or weapon typically takes at least six weeks, but this time is reduced by a number of weeks equal to the character's Intelligence modifier (an Intelligence penalty doesn't increase the time needed). Training costs 25 gp per workweek. Individual weeks of training don't need to be consecutive, but a character cannot receive training in more than one field at a time.</p><hr><h1>Downtime Activities - Special</h1><h2>Learn a Spell</h2><p>Certain beings have the unique ability to teach certain spells to others - with great effort even to those without the Spellcasting or Pact Magic features.</p><h5>Requirements</h5><p>A character can only choose this activity if they know a suitable and willing teacher. Such teachers usually don't come cheap and often expect to be paid not in favors instead of gold.</p><h5>Resolution</h5><p>The character must choose one of the spells the teacher is willing and able to teach them. A character can learn spells of a spell level up to one third of their character level, rounded down. The process of learning and then casting the spell differs between casters - characters with the Spellcasting or Pact Magic features - and those without.</p><p><strong>Spellcasters.</strong> Learning a spell this way takes a character with the Spellcasting or Pact Magic features two weeks per level of the spell. Once learned, the spell counts as part of the character's class' spell list and can be cast using the character's spell slots like any other spell. If they are a prepared caster, they must prepare the spell as normal to cast it. If the spell is a ritual, the character can cast it as such.</p><p><strong>Non-Casters.</strong> Those without the Spellcasting or Pact Magic features take three times as long to learn the spell - six weeks per level of the spell. Once learned, the spell counts as an innate spell which they can cast once per day. If the spell is a ritual, the spell doesn't have a daily limit but it can only be cast as a ritual. If a non-caster character later becomes a spellcaster, the rules for spellcasters apply instead.</p><hr>"

Inside, a magnificent white eagle is trapped, its pristine feathers dulled by the shadows. Its sharp eyes search for something—someone—through the haze of its confinement, and when they lock onto yours, a shiver runs down your spine.</p><p>Then, behind the cage, an imposing figure emerges from the darkness: a frost giant, towering and fearsome. Clad in heavy, jagged armor that glimmers like ice under the flickering light, it looms over the eagle, on its head sits a wide-brimmed wizard’s hat.</p><p>You can only watch in horror as the giant raises a massive hand, fingers like icicles curling around the eagle's feathers. One by one, he rips them out with a slow, deliberate cruelty. Each tug is a reminder of pain, and the eagle’s cries pierce your soul—a desperate plea for freedom, a haunting call for mercy that echoes within you.</p><p>As its gaze remains locked onto yours, you see the anguish in its eyes, seeking deliverance from the grip of its captor.

It wrought havoc amongst the devils' ranks but eventually - through their trickery and cunning - it fell into a deep ravine and was never seen again. Over time, the land shifted, and as the ravine closed, holes began to appear in the ground spewing forth black smoke. The devils, curious as to where these vents led, explored them. Only the ones that stayed near the surface returned.</p><p>But when the remains and personal belongings of the others began to fall from the sky in Dis, it became clear that the vents formed a connection between the two planes - and that something lived inside of them.</p><p>In another tale you hear of ten Pit Fiends sent to slay the creature dwelling within the vents. When none returned, Zariel herself took on the task. She did return - bloodied and bruised - and immediately decapitated the first devil who dared ask if she had succeeded.

          "content": "<p>Just as Aviana's hand closed around Plex's neck, the goblin's curse took hold once more and transported him into the Feywild - only for Aviana's curse to take hold as well and bring her along.</p><p>The two appeared in the middle of a clearing in a vibrant forest, and surrounded by a few dozen Satyrs who're dancing, drinking, playing music, and partying. Their music suddenly stopped however once they got interrupted by Plex's choking gasps for air and Aviana's \"Listen here you little shit...\".</p><p>The satyrs clearly weren't amused and what followed was an honest effort of diplomacy from Aviana. Which was interrupted only briefly when she noticed that she was still holding Plex aloft by his throat, and that this particular image probably wasn't helping her diplomatic efforts. So she let the goblin go, who immediately teleported away from Aviana. Or rather tried to, as his first attempt resulted in him just teleporting from Aviana's left to her right. The 2nd attempt that followed was successful however and Aviana lost sight of the goblin.</p><p> </p><p>She continued her efforts to make peace with the satyrs but was having a tough time as she made one social faux pas (in the satyr's eyes that is) after another. When Aviana saw the rainbow-colored glow and heard the bleats coming from the forest's edge, she immediately knew what was to come and instantly regretted ever letting go of Plex's neck. The Lantern Goat stormed onto the clearing with Plex on it's back holding onto its horns for dear life. Now that was the kind of diplomacy the satyrs could get behind, and soon the music, dancing, and drinking started again, with Aviana, Plex, and the Lantern Goat as guests of honour. </p><p>All were having a good time until Aviana couldn't restrain herself any longer. The large boulder at the edge of the clearing was the first thing she noticed when she arrived here and she instantly knew that not lifting it would be something she'd regret for the rest of her life. The boulder's bizarre shape just made it even more intriguing, as it reminded her a lot of a giant goat's head. So she went over, grabbed it, and - didn't lift it. \"Strange\", she thought to herself and tried again, putting all of her strength into the lift. Much to her satisfaction, the boulder moved.</p><p>Much to her, and everyone else's, dissatisfaction however, it wasn't just the boulder that moved. The earth beneath the clearing shook and rose, higher and higher, until all could see the tops of the trees beneath them. Off in the distance, Aviana even saw a large patch of forest was completely grey. She didn't have much opportunity to ponder that however, as the head-like boulder she tried to lift turned out to be an actual head after all. Namely the head of a mythical Mountain Goat, who had been slumbering for eons. Who was very displeased with Aviana's attempts to tear its head off.</p><p>A fight for survival ensued as the Mountain Goat bucked and shook. The satyrs tried to hold on but one by one they fell off the Mountain Goat's back, disappearing into the treetops below with a scream. Plex wasn't having any issues himself as he had correctly figured that a goat wouldn't have any issues standing on another goat, and so he had once again climbed onto the Lantern Goat's back. Due to his growing experience with using unwilling Lantern Goats as mounts, he was finding it easier and easier to hold on. This even allowed him to save several of the satyrs from certain death, as he teleported them safely to the ground.</p><p>Aviana, unwilling - and unable - to let go of ~~her boulder~~ the Mountain Goat's head, looked for a way to resolve this situation and the first solution that came to her mind was, unsurprisingly, the broken Iron Flask. She grabbed it from her pockets and threw it at the Mountain Goat - and missed. Plex, witnessing Aviana's valiant attempt from the relative safety of the Lantern Goat's back, couldn't help but be impressed by Aviana's ability to miss a creature the size of a small mountain as he saw the small bottle plummet into the forest below - only to be followed by Aviana, who had no intentions of losing her precious Iron Flask.</p><p>Figuring it was a good time for him to leave as well, he teleported himself and the Lantern Goat down to the ground where Aviana was frantically searching for her Iron Flask. After a few minutes of searching - while fighting off the Mountain Goat's attempts to trample her - she eventually found her Iron Flask and noticed that the brass stopper was firmly closed. Before she had time to wonder what was now inside the flask, the Mountain Goat's hoof stomped down and Aviana barely managed to turn around and catch it. The weight of the colossal creature made her sink into the ground but she didn't budge. Getting stomped to death by a giant goat was not how she planned to die!</p><p>The Lantern Goat Plex was riding - or rather was trying to ride as he had no way of controlling it - was about to run past Aviana and the Goblin figured this was a good an opportunity to leave as they were gonna get. He just needed a moment to cast a spell - and for that his mount would have to be still for even a second. He shouted at Aviana and the conversation that followed went something like this: </p><p>Plex: \"Hold the goat!\"</p><p>Aviana: \"I AM! CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?\" </p><p>Lantern Goat: \"Bleeee!\"</p><p>Mountain Goat ( *very annoyed*): \"**BLEEEEEEE**\"</p><p>Plex: \"Nooo, the other goat!\"</p><p>Aviana ( *also very annoyed*): \"LISTEN HERE YOU LITTLE SHIT...\"</p><p>Lantern Goat: \"Bleeee???\"</p><p>And so Aviana grabbed the Lantern Goat's horn as it ran past, now holding up the Mountain Goat's weight with just one hand. Plex used this moment to open a teleportation gate in the ground beneath them and he, Aviana, and the Lanter Goat all fell through. A few hundred feet away, at the other end of the gate, Aviana got launched several hundred feet into the air as the force of the Mountain Goat's hoof pushed her through. Her fall back down was slowed by several tree branches so she was barely falling anymore when she landed on the ground. Plex, pleased with his efforts to save himself, Aviana and, most importantly, the Lantern Goat, realised that the Mountain Goat was still coming for them. And that he would very much like Fearghas to see it...</p><p>When Plex felt Aviana's hand tighten around his neck like a vice once more, he felt the weave around him snap as her action caused a wild magic surge. The world around Plex twisted and he felt like his stomach was pulled through his nose - the oh so familiar feeling of unwilling planar teleportation.</p>"

A wild magic surge happened, just as I was shapeshifting into the form of a spider and I've been stuck like this ever since. Not much more I can say about it. I think I just got unlucky. Or maybe I got lucky, seeing how much worse it could have gone. I'm sure my mother would have blamed Lolth for it. She always believed that anything bad happening to us was Lolth's doing. As some kind of punishment for her fleeing Ul'ath'tallar.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>if she knows much about the shadowfel</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"Awful place. Been there for a job once, only very briefly however. I was after the head of a Sil'lael noble who thought fleeing there was a good idea. Of course I followed him but by the time if found him, he was already clawing out his own eyes. Made it easy for me but I couldn't even be happy about that. Damn mist felt like it was draining my soul and sanity. After I cut off his head, I noped the fuck out of there as quickly as I could. Didn't want to push my luck and further.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I would talk to her baout my psionic blades and see if she knows anything else about that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"They're certainly useful, too bad you said you can't teach me how to use them myself. Have I seen them before? No but I know an assassin, a Shadar'kai, whose targets would apparently just drop dead. No wounds, no poisons, nothing. He also never carried any weapons. You kinda remind me of him actually. If we're ever in Al-Qasir, I'll see if I can find him.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>if she has ever heard of the living shadows attached to people</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"While I was in the Shadowfell, I had to fight off some shadows that were moving around on their own like yours but at least those weren't attached to someone. Not much, but that's all I know, sorry.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>see if there is something we could look in to and maybe help her as well to get back to normal one day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"To be honest, I'm not sure if I wanted to. I've been like this for many years and it's become pretty normal to me. People were scared of me before too so not much changed for me. Other than not being able to shapeshift anymore but I think I'd avoid that even if I could. Bad memories, you know.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>see if she would be willing to talk about vandree. or if she knows anything about how to find them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"As I said, I'd rather not get involved with them. They're one of the mightiest houses in Ul'ath'tallar and in the past, back when the twin matrons still ruled together, I've worked both with and against them. The latter was a mistake I do not wish to repeat. If you're really set on finding Filrae, why don't you ask her sister?\"</p>\n<h1>Rest of Convo</h1>\n<p><em>(sorry I couldn't be bothered to rewrite and reformat this properly)</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Kyrin</strong>\n\"I would talk to her baout my psionic blades and see if she knows anything else about that.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Kali</strong>\n\"They're certainly useful, too bad you said you can't teach me how to use them myself. Have I seen them before? No but I know an assassin, a Shadar'kai, whose targets would apparently just drop dead. No wounds, no poisons, nothing. He also never carried any weapons. You kinda remind me of him actually. If we're ever in Al-Qasir, I'll see if I can find him.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Kyrin</strong>\n\"I would like that very much. Thank you for the offer. I don't really know of anyone like me. I'm sure you can understand that too. I dont know if I could be affected by a magic surge in the same way you are and be stuck between. I suppose i might be able to be forced into just One form, but even that I'm not sure of..\"</p>\n<p><strong>Kali</strong>\n\"No problems, but please remind me should I forget. Regarding wild magic surges, I'd assume you could get stuck halfway between your child and adult forms.\" <em>Kali shudders at the thought of being stuck as teenager forever.</em> \"Let's hope that won't happen.\"</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Kyrin</strong>\n\"if she has ever heard of the living shadows attached to people\"</p>\n<p><strong>Kali</strong>\n\"While I was in the Shadowfell, I had to fight off some shadows that were moving around on their own like yours but at least those weren't attached to someone. Not much, but that's all I know, sorry.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Kyrin</strong>\n\"when we were studying in the tower library I found some information on shadows. They said that strong emotion or trauma from our plane can cause them to form in the shadowfell and its possible that the same could happen here from something happening there. its the best idea i have to go on so far but that one doesn't speak often. <em>pointing to the shadow</em> I am from Taldor Augusta, if i remember correctly and i may be wrong, i think they said you had haunted the city a bit as well. There is a place there that I have spent some time, its a place i enjoy really for the solitude and shadows. <em>pulls out my notebook</em> I show her the etchings from grey lamp ally as i tell her about the place. Does this mean anything to you? (if the words are sylvan i cant read them if they are deep i can however it might be something she knows way more about than me as she is well traveled)\"</p>\n<p><strong>Kali</strong>\n\"Hm I wonder what could possibly cause that strong of an emotion in the Shadowfell.\"\n<em>Kali's eyes drop for a moment when she hears the word 'haunted'.</em> \"The city was my home for a few years, yes.\"\n\"That lamp is very interesting. It reminds me a lot of those Quadiran lamps. You know, the ones you're supposed to rub while wishing for something. The writing is interesting too, what does it say?\"</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Kyrin</strong>\n\"see if there is something we could look in to and maybe help her as well to get back to normal one day.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Kali</strong>\n\"To be honest, I'm not sure if I wanted to. I've been like this for many years and it's become pretty normal to me. People were scared of me before too so not much changed for me. Other than not being able to shapeshift anymore but I think I'd avoid that even if I could. Bad memories, you know.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Kyrin</strong>\n\"I can understand that. Sometimes its comforting being one familiar shape, even if its less mmmm… useful? <em>i sit in my little web hammock chair swinging my feet like a little kid</em> its really quite peaceful here. I can see why it would be appealing, no one to bother you uninvited <em>I give her a big cheeky smile</em> the thought of the fall and stop is a bit daunting but the view is great. Anyway, we can always keep it a thought though if i ever come across anything that could help I will keep you updated.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Kali</strong>\n\"I appreciate it.\" <em>Kali returns the smile for just a moment before following your gaze and looking down.</em> \"The fall itself is great, can't say much about the impact though, I've always prefered to avoid that. And yeah, I enjoy the solitude here. If someone were to bother me here uninvited, at least I know they'd have a very good reason for it.\"\n<em>She falls silent for a moment, seemingly deep in thought before turning her head back towards you.</em> \"You're always welcome here though.\"</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Kyrin</strong>\n\"see if she would be willing to talk about vandree. or if she knows anything about how to find them.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Kali</strong>\n\"As I said, I'd rather not get involved with them. They're one of the mightiest houses in Ul'ath'tallar and in the past, back when the twin matrons still ruled together, I've worked both with and against them. The latter was a mistake I do not wish to repeat. If you're really that set on finding Filrae, why don't you ask her sister?\"</p>\n<p><strong>Kyrin</strong>\n\"Filrae? I didnt know there was a sister. To be honest I don't know much about them at all aside from the little interaction i have had with them and their agents, and of course our little gnome friend here. Aside from what the matron did to me she deserves to be punished for what she has done to her and her friend. ( I would ask Nami to tell her about what has been being said to her recently just on the off shoot it softens her stance a little more. ) Do you know where this Filrae can be found or anything about her?\"</p>\n<p><strong>Kali</strong>\n\"Oh, you didn't? I've told the others about the Vandree twins already. After their mother died, the two ruled the house together and it was under their leadership that House Vandree became one of the great houses in Ul'ath'tallar. Then Filrae vanished and her sister Minae has been searching for her ever since. At least that's the official story.\" \n<em>When Naami recounts her recent experiences with the matron, Kali listens intently.</em> \"I'm not surprised. She has no reason to just silence you so she can take as much time as she wants to make you suffer.\"\n\"But you're right, she has to be stopped.\" <em>She closes her eyes for a moment and lets out a long sigh before opening them again.</em> \"What I told you earlier - about me having worked with the twins in the past that being the reason I don't want to get involved - that was a lie. I was hoping you wouldn't prod further.\" \n<em>Kali pauses for a moment and gathers herself.</em> \"I was just a newborn when Filrae vanished so I only know what little my mother told me. We fled the city shortly Filrae's disappearance and my mother was killed by an assassin of the house many years later. Silenced. I guess she knew something she shouldn't have known. Always said that she was just protecting me by not speaking about it - and I was hoping I could do the same for you.\nI don't know much, but I know someone who might be able to tell us more. Velkyn Arkenaii - a friend of my mother who fled the city with us and helped us escape. Last I've seen him was shortly after my mother's death about 50 years ago. After her funeral he said goodbye and told me not to contact him again. When I asked him where he'd go he just said 'to lands once noble'. Good heart but man was he a strange fellow.\"</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Kyrin</strong>\n\"Is there anything you want to know from me or anything I could maybe help you with? You have been so kind in showing us your space and speaking with us. (also depending on if we are faffing around here still while she goes after fergus's family I would offer to help. If we are away doing something then not. not sure if she would politely decline because she works better alone but the offer is out there.)\"</p>\n<p><strong>Kali</strong>\n\"I'll think about it and get back to you if I may? And thanks for the offer to help me with my job but you'd just get in the way. No offense, I prefer working alone.\"</p>\n<hr>"

          "content": "<p>\"This way,\" the wizard said, clutching his book in the folds of his cloak.</p><p>The party followed him, hunched against the blizzard; a tall human in plate armour, a dwarf who was missing his right hand, and a Halfling wrapped up so only her brilliant green eyes showed. The wizard, another human muffled in an embroidered purple cloak, led the way with growing excitement. The others did not come close to sharing his sentiment.</p><p>\"It's too cold,\" the knight said, holding his shield to protect the Halfling from the biting winds. \"Naami won't make it.\"</p><p>\"Don't worry about me,\" she muttered through her scarf.</p><p>\"That's the spirit! Think of the wonders that await us in the ruins,\" Daman exclaimed. \"Ancient magic, forgotten glyphs, records of feats nowadays only dreamed of! This blizzard is surely conjured up by their runes, to protect the temple. The ancient people -\"</p><p>They never learnt what Daman was about to say about the ancient people, as he was silenced in the middle of his tirade by snow swirling into his mouth. Coughing and cursing, he turned to face forward again, stomping as if to beat the ice into submission.</p><p>\"It's wrong,\" the dwarf said, shaking his head. \"The ancients' magic cost me my right hand, and he wants *more* of that?\"</p><p>\"Seeking knowledge is not wrong in itself,\" Osten said firmly. \"But the price he is willing to pay to get it... *that* is wrong.\"</p><p>He held out his hand to help Naami stand after she stumbled face first in the snow. The small healer endured bravely, but for someone who had spent most of her life in a desert, the climate proved a bigger threat than to the rest of them.</p><p>\"It's fine,\" she said. \"When we get back, I'll make us hot tea and we can warm ourselves by the fire.\"</p><p>\"When we get back,\" Osten said, \"I'll make us tea while you warm yourself.\"</p><p>\"If we get back,\" Magnus grumbled. \"The blizzard is only growing worse. It's madness to be out in this. Nature is fighting our every step.\"</p><p>Daman yelped and ran back a few steps, stammering about something in the snow. Osten signalled to Magnus and he nodded, stepping closer to Naami. The knight advanced to where Daman had stood, and went still. He slowly raised his shield.</p><p>\"We have a problem,\" he said in a voice that barely reached to the rest of the party. \"Stench of rotting flesh in a blizzard. We've entered the territory of -\"</p><p>A red flash burst from the snow, whipping at Osten. He blocked with an oath, his boots digging into the snow under the force of the impact. Just in front of him, an ominous silhouette emerged. It was darker than the ice, tinged with blue like a deep frozen lake. Taller than a pillar, it grew a mass of blood-red tendrils near the top. The one that had hit Osten retreated, and the creature resolved into a gigantic slug, its head and back covered in crystals.</p><p>\"What in the world is *that*?\" Naami squeaked.</p><p>\"Rime worm,\" Osten growled. \"We've stumbled into their territory. We're prey now.\"</p><p>As if to give reason to the knight's words, the slug collapsed on top of him, dark maw gaping. Osten activated the magic in his shield; blue light pulsed in a shockwave, barely repelling the monster. He thrust with his sword, burying it into the creature's mouth. The rime worm recoiled with a howl that was more vibration than audible noise, rattling Naami's teeth.</p><p>\"Monsters from cold climes, right?\" Magnus asked, but did not wait for an answer. \"That thing must be weak to fire!\"</p><p>He held his staff aloft, a length of ash carved so it still seemed to be living and growing. From the tip, fire sparked into existence and streaked towards the slug. It sizzled as it hit, black smoke billowing from the impact. The rime worm reared into the air, tendrils lashing at the snow, then its body began to loom over the party.</p><p>\"It's going to crush us, fall back!\" Osten cried.</p><p>The two spellcasters obeyed, but Naami stepped forward instead. She had taken her gloves off, and her fingers traced sigils in the freezing air, precise patterns to guide her magic. The ominous shadow of the rime worm over Osten blurred and twisted, then leapt up and wound around its owner's body. Hands clenched into fists, the Halfling planted her feet into the snow.</p><p>\"Can't hold the spell very long,\" she said through gritted teeth.</p><p>\"I will protect you!\" Osten said. \"We can buy them time.\"</p><p>Behind them, Magnus and Daman stood close, threads of magic twining around them. Daman held his book close to his chest, speaking incantations in a clear voice. The words wrapped around a ball of flame hovering atop Magnus' staff.</p><p>\"Now!\" The dwarf said.</p><p>With a flick of his wrist, Magnus passed the fireball to Daman. The human's spell took in the blaze, and propelled it towards the slug at a speed Magnus alone would have been unable of. The burning ball hit the monster square in the face, sending it into a rage.</p><p>\"It survived that?\" The Halfling cried in disbelief.</p><p>\"Naami, watch out!\"</p><p>The knight threw himself in front of his friend, just in time to block several tendrils streaking towards her. They made a fleshy thud on his shield, but the sheer force of the attack forced Osten to his knees. He groaned, his voice raising into a scream as his shield arm fell limp to his side.</p><p>\"Osten!\" Naami's weaves snapped, her spell's hold on the rime worm fading.</p><p>Suddenly free, the monster crawled towards her, opening its maw wide. Osten scrambled to his feet, face white with pain. Naami reached out to him without thinking, her magic washing over her friend's body. Her powerful healing mended the broken bones, and Osten stood tall once more. With a nod of gratitude, he raised his shield. The mages at the back were channelling a new spell, combining the wildfire of Magnus' magic with Daman's years of obsessive study and his extensive knowledge of physics. One more spell would kill the monster. It had to.</p><p>Osten stood ready to block another attempt to devour him or Naami, but the slug did not fall forward this time. Inside the open maw, a sickly light flickered and grew, then took the shape of dark icicles, sharpened to a needle point.</p><p>\"This thing has magic?\" Naami cried, her stomach filled with dread.</p><p>\"Get behind me!\" Osten said.</p><p>He spared a second to smile at her over his shoulder before turning to face the monster, his shoulders squared, ready to endure anything. Behind Naami, magic swelled and shaped into another offensive spell. She wanted to close her eyes but she began to weave another healing spell instead, preparing to mend the inevitable wounds. A hail of frozen spikes rushed towards Osten; the magic of his shield expanded in a blue dome to protect them all. Black ice pelted the barrier in a blinding flash of magic. Naami's eyes exploded in pain as if they had been pierced by the spikes. She was only aware of magic for a dizzying moment; the shield's magic above her head, the rime worm's attack, the combined spell bursting into existence behind her. The spell rushed past her just as she recovered her vision, a ray of white-hot flame exploding on the slug's body. It gave one last reverberating howl and crashed onto the rocky ground, shuddering into stillness. Deafening silence swallowed the din of battle. They had won.</p><p>\"It's... dead?\" Daman said, spellbook trembling in his hands.</p><p>Magnus sank to his knees, beard full of ice, his hands reaching down to the earth beneath the snow. Naami released her spell, letting a web of positive energy settle on her friends. She was dimly aware of strength returning to Magnus' legs, of Daman's hands growing steadier. From Osten, she sensed nothing. Her heart went cold. He had fallen on his side with his shield arm at an unnatural angle, but her healing did not touch him. She made herself take a step towards him, then another, and each new step was infinitely heavier than the last. Deep down, she knew. Her spells never failed. She knew, but she could not accept it.</p><p>Her friend was dead. Dirt-blonde hair seemed dark against his face; his sapphire eyes stared at the sky. His pale eyelashes had frozen, and his armour was so covered in frost as to seem made of ice. A jolt of pain in her knees told Naami her legs had failed her. The pain of her body was distant, an annoyance that had no right to exist beside the agony in her heart. Osten had protected her in a world gone from wonderful to terrifying. Osten had shared tea with her on nights where the cold could have split the very mountains. Osten had always had a kind word, a smile, an encouraging gesture. Naami sensed Magnus and Daman on either side of her, kneeling in silence. She could not bear their sorrow. She heard it in their silence, in the lack of words from friends who were never quiet. Their silence was another drop in a sea of pain, and yet it was too much. She had to break it, before it broke her too.</p><p>\"I can bring him back.\"</p><p>Naami realised she had spoken aloud. Stunned, she listened to the echo of her words in the frozen air. Her heart pounded in her chest, trying to break her ribs. Her legs would not move. She could barely feel her fingers from the cold, but she knew she had not only spoken from the depths of her heart; she had told the truth.</p><p>\"Naami...\" Magnus reached out to her with the stump of his right hand. \"You're a powerful healer, you gave it your all, but you must not push yourself so. No one blames you.\"</p><p>\"The amount of magic that would take... it is impossible,\" Daman said in the voice of a lecturer; as if he would ever have the patience for teaching. \"We'll give him the proper rites, and take care of the living.\"</p><p>She clenched her teeth. They thought she was losing her mind, but she knew. As she had known Osten was dead, she knew she could bring him back.</p><p>\"I'm serious,\" she said. \"I need time, but I can do it.\"</p><p>She had to crane her neck to look at Daman, but she put all her resolve into that look. He knew the rules of magic better than she ever would, yes. But he was not a witch, and none of his theory could explain why she needed her spellwards to function, the same as she could not use his spellbook for as much as lighting a candle. He did not understand how her magic worked. She hardly understood her own magic, for the matter; she only felt that it would work. The gods be thanked, Daman saw she meant it. With a sigh, he rose to his feet and opened his book.</p><p>\"I maintain we don't have enough magic. No sacrifice to make. But if you wish to try, then I will shield you from the elements.\"</p><p>He spoke as a king granting a favour to a commoner. In spite of herself, Naami grinned. Daman had a flamboyant manner, dominating a room with his presence despite his light build. This grand manner of speaking was just like him. Somehow this piece of \"normal\" opened a crack in the pain of her heart. Magnus merely gestured with his left hand, effortlessly conjuring a flame in mid-air.</p><p>\"You'll need some warmth to move these fingers,\" he said gruffly. \"I'll be looking at how you do it, if you don't mind me.\"</p><p>Naami surprised herself by giggling. \"I expect as much. Thank you.\"</p><p>The dwarf nodded, a shadow of a smile hiding in his beard. He began melting the snow with his magical flame while Daman walked in a perfect circle around them, muttering incantations. Slowly the magic shifted in his wake, the air becoming warm and dry. A bubble enveloped the party, the snow sliding off the invisible barrier. Magnus' flames melted the flakes before they could bury the party's shelter. A piece of rough stone ground appeared as the snow was cleared. It would make an uncomfortable seat, but Naami sat by Osten nonetheless, crossing her legs under her heavy skirts. Her mind returned to her desert home; when she closed her eyes, she could imagine she was back in Ildilas. Of course Osten had never set foot on Bottleneck Coast. Maybe one day, he would. If she could only reach out to his soul... Naami shut out the world. She flexed her numb fingers and paused for a moment, feeling the smooth bands of the bangles which allowed her to control magic without being consumed by it. She made her breathing steady, made her mind calm, and she took off her spellwards.</p><p>Resting her fingers on Osten's chest, she cast out her mind far from the confines of her body. She searched the aether for a trace of Osten's soul, for the warmth she was now familiar with. Her mind wandered, little more than a vague sense of self in the darkness. She sensed sparks of life, but none felt like her friend. It was much too soon to give up, however. As an Ildic witch, one the omens had smiled on, she was acquainted with the veil between light and darkness, life and death. She strayed closer, calling out to Osten.</p><p>\"Come back,\" she said in her trance. \"Your story isn't over yet, so come back.\"</p><p>Silence answered her. This was not right; if Osten's soul had sensed her presence, it would have echoed her words. She could not explain how, but she knew. She called out again, to no avail. Letting silence embrace her, she allowed her mind to sink into motionlessness. A breath of cold touched her cheek; it was infinitely distant. Her body seemed to wait on the other shore of a dark sea, but the cold helped. Silence, stillness, and stasis had always strengthened her magic, until the moment she spoke the spell. Part of her sensed the danger of staying here, mind and body separate. Stay too long, and she would not find her way back. She ignored the risks. Instead of calling out to Osten, she merely thought of him, of his soul. Her own soul began to shift, like colour gradually changing, a wavelength slowly altering. It hurt; even as she was now, without a body, the shift made her ache more with each passing second. Intuition spurring her on, she persevered through the pain.</p><p>Responding to the paralysing ache, an echo touched her consciousness. Naami was so startled she nearly lost concentration, but she recovered in time to cling to the fading echo. It was Osten, but it also was not him. While she recognised his soul, it was so terribly far, so different from hers that it might as well come from another world. It was hollow and confused, missing part of what made him who he was.</p><p>\"Don't go,\" she pleaded.</p><p>Pain washed over her in response, a hollow ache so strong she could have screamed. Like having her heart ripped out. She held onto it, sensing the answer lay this way. She made herself go closer to the pain, made the wavelength of her soul change further. She adjusted herself to the ache, embraced it, wishing she could cry. Within the pain was a sense of hunger, of yearning, stronger than she had ever known. It was on the edge of consuming her; she kept the most tenuous grip on her consciousness.</p><p>\"Naami?\"</p><p>Osten's voice. She would have burst into tears had she been able. She tried to respond through the pain, but she had no voice. The veil was a wall now, and the voice on the other side was entirely alien. She was a cloud trying to speak to a person. Holding on by a fingernail, she communicated the only way she could think of; by altering the emotion suffusing the ache threatening to tear her apart. She fed it all the pain she had ever felt, the grief, the loss. She gave it her own wishes, her yearning for the next sunrise. With a sharp click, the emotions within her aligned with those in Osten's soul. It shook her mind but she held on tight, the memories of her friend lending her strength. Now that there was a connection through the wall, which was the veil between this life and the next, she could speak to him. The words mattered very little in this space; emotion and magic carried the message. A whole world away, she heard a whisper come from her body.</p><p>\"We miss you already. Come back.\"</p><p>Voices answered, so distant she only barely made them out.</p><p>\"It... is impossible... magic wants a sacrifice... how is she doing this...\"</p><p>\"She is paying the cost. The sacrifice... is her.\"</p><p>The voices faded, Osten's presence growing clearer.</p><p>\"Come with me instead. Pharasma calls to me. I'm drawn to a wide river. I don't want to go alone.\"</p><p>\"You don't have to go,\" she said. \"Come back with me.\"</p><p>\"I'm afraid, Naami.\"</p><p>\"Then follow me! We can go home.\"</p><p>\"But the sound of battle is finally gone. I think... if I sink into the river, I will be at peace for the first time.\"</p><p>\"If you go to the river, I will never see you again,\" Naami cried.</p><p>If Osten went to the River of Souls, he would finally know peace. Osten had lived a life of battles, until he made his last stand to protect his friends. He had earned his peace and rest. Tearing him from a realm where his soul would know quiet at last... that would be nothing short of cruelty. *Sometimes a healer must inflict pain*, Naami's mother had said when she was teaching her, a lifetime ago. Setting a bone would always hurt. Bitter herbs made you think you truly would do better without them. It was nothing, compared to robbing a soul of the peace it so deeply deserved... but the principle was the same. Naami was Osten's friend, but she was a healer, too. And... she missed him.</p><p>\"Come back. Death will meet you later, but we are here now. We miss you. Let's spend just another day together, and if the gods allow it, another after that. Death will embrace you when our story is over.\"</p><p>No matter how long or painful the journey, it would have an end. It was a comforting thought. There would be quiet at the end, so why not make a little more noise in the meantime? Naami's thin grasp on consciousness was overwhelmed with warmth, with the feeling of Osten's smile. Had she had a body in this strange place, she would have opened her arms to hug him, to welcome him back. She would do it soon. His soul phased through the veil which was a wall for her, away from the River of Souls, far from the call of the Spiral of Fate. Side by side in a dream of twilight, they returned from a battle that had taken place in their hearts.</p><p>Naami woke to pain, her body burning. Her hands on Osten's chest felt as though severed from her body, lumps of flesh she could not command. A sliver of sensation remained, enough to know her fingers were ablaze with pain. Her head was light and heavy, her thoughts drowning within themselves. Breathing was agony, but there was just one last thing to do. One task left, and then she could rest. She smiled through the pain, gathered her magic, and settled it on Osten's body. Her magic whispered to his heart, reminded it of the beat of life. Her magic caught a wisp of air, leading it into her friend's still lungs. She guided the blood back into his veins, and when his body was restored to life, she gave his soul one last invitation.</p><p>\"Come back to us, Osten.\"</p><p>As the knight's eyes opened, magic escaped Naami's control. It leapt from her, humming and dancing. A warm breeze laughed around the party, and flowers burst into existence beneath them and around them, a carpet of wild colours. She recognised none of the blossoms, and the ones who grew outside of Daman's barrier froze in a heartbeat, turning dark and stiff with ice. Inside the barrier, the rock was covered in vibrant colours, the air saturated with sweet scents.</p><p>\"The magic...\" Naami murmured.</p><p>When no one said anything, she looked at her friends. Osten was sitting up, still pale as death, a confused look in his eyes. Magnus was looking down at his left hand, and more intensely at the stump of his right hand. Daman had sunk to his knees, eyes wide, his usual charisma shattered.</p><p>\"I saw... I was...\" Osten began, voice hoarse. \"Scales on my arms, bestial strength in them... I had claws... and the breath of winter in my chest... I was... What was I...?\"</p><p>\"I had a right hand again,\" Magnus said, \"but it was different... wrong. And yet it felt like it was made for me, better than the one I had before. Dark magic around it... strange... my flames always burned so bright... it felt like home... but how...\"</p><p>Daman was pale as the snow outside the barrier. His mouth moved soundlessly at first, unable to form words.</p><p>\"The void,\" he said finally, his voice thin and weak. \"Gods save us, the void is coming.\"</p><p>His eyes rolled back into his head and he crumpled in a faint. Naami tried to go to him to revive him, but exhaustion crashed down on her. Her head spun, and before she knew it, she was in Magnus' arms. His right arm was stiff as wood, but he held her gently. She realised she could not move, her strength entirely spent.</p><p>\"Easy there,\" he said, the cold in his voice fading as he spoke. \"You were sitting here for a full hour. You've done the impossible. Take a break.\"</p><p>The impossible. He was right. She had cast a spell that demands a sacrifice, without paying that cost. But then, she thought as she glimpsed her spellwards on the ground, maybe she had merely found another way to pay the cost for that magic; a way only a witch could find. She feebly reached out towards her bracelets. Osten handed them out to her. Colour was returning to his face; he breathed deeply as if relishing the very sensation.</p><p>\"It's a strange dream I woke from,\" he said with a smile. \"I think we all saw things, too. I'm not sure I want to know what Daman saw.\"</p><p>\"Whatever it was, it's of no concern to us right now,\" Magnus grumbled. \"There are more pressing matters. Slapping some life back into Daman, so we can be on our way. He'll talk when he feels like it, or he won't. Hopefully someone will pay us for killing this thing; nature is relieved by its death, at least. All I want now is mulled wine, my bones are frozen.\"</p><p>\"I feel warmer, somehow,\" Osten said. \"Like a deep cold inside me has been denied... turned away.\"</p><p>\"Let's make it so it stays away,\" Magnus said, shuffling through the wild flowers towards Daman.</p><p>Naami grinned. She had a feeling that she would see stranger things the next day. And, if the gods allowed it, she would see even stranger things the day after that.</p>"

          "content": "<p>Emilio's white hair seemed to glow in the dimness, a patch of clean snow on a backdrop of reddish hell. He raised his bandaged hand as if to curse the twisted creature that had Aviana in a chokehold; three bursts of energy leapt from his fingers and exploded on the mass of bulging flesh and organs. Clouds of purple smoke erupted, and the creature shuddered and collapsed, remaining still. It did not look like it had ever been alive, or even moving. It looked like a tangle of surgical mistakes, or insane experiments. It looked like madness clad in flesh, a chunk that had been torn off from this place. Aviana, finally free, began to argue with Plex. Naami started towards her, unable to look away from the wounds covering the harpy from talons to wingtips.</p>\n<p>\"I'll give us a semblance of safety so we can recuperate,\" Fearghas grumbled.</p>\n<p>Spellbook in hand, he began to mutter and trace sigils into the air, raising a familiar barrier around the party. Just then, the voice spoke into their heads again: <em>Yes, pause and breathe in the tranquillity, dear ones. The transition from the River to the boundless peace of Nirvana can be… intense. Rest is a balm, and I am here to offer comfort and guidance.</em></p>\n<p>\"That demon's weird,\" the dwarf said once the protective bubble was complete.</p>\n<p>\"Let me cast a spell of trap detection,\" Aviana said, frowning in concentration. \"Ah, I see! The walls are traps. The floors are traps, and the ceiling is a trap, too. Now the danger of these traps is… are… confusion and disorientation, madness, acid, suffocation… errrm… poison, infestation with maggots, also exhausting, blindness… and losing the ability to escape. Well. Plex, can you bite me?\"</p>\n<p>Naami stared, her argument forgotten. Aviana the unbreakable harpy was bleeding and bruised, covered in acid burns, and she wanted to be <em>bitten</em> on top of it? Plex, who had been shrunk to the size of a rat by a wild magic surge, started to argue that he was too small to have a chance to even break the skin. Likely he still would be, even at his normal size. Plex, who had teleported away the moment we arrived here, <em>willingly</em>, and nearly got himself eaten, digested, and killed, in any order. Twice. Plex, whom Naami had healed at the cost of her own blood. She had been so relieved to see him alive, her control on magic had slipped, and she had transferred her life force to him, closing all his wounds. Plex was nonchalantly agreeing to more violence, only discussing the logistics of it, as Aviana was urging him to hit her.</p>\n<p>In the madness of the situation, Naami's fear flashed to anger. She wished she could brush off her actions as consequences of emotion, as losing control of herself; a form of madness maybe. That would be a lie. She deliberately drew her sharp dagger. She decided to stalk to Aviana and point that dagger at her. Oh, she was much too small to threaten the harpy, grown to a huge size by alchemy. But a threat needed not be made on a person's life, and some wounds were worse than death. Naami angled her blade at Aviana's heels, where a small cut would be as severing her feet from her legs. She could heal a snapped tendon, though it would cost her.</p>\n<p>\"Aviana, you sit still now and let me heal those wounds, or I promise I will make you.\"</p>\n<p>Just then, Plex worked out how to hit Aviana, and followed through with it, whacking her with his staff. She did not flinch, and Naami was past paying attention to it, but that did not stop Aviana from requesting Naami stab her with the dagger she had just threatened her with. </p>\n<p>Before she could reply, the gentle voice spoke in Naami's mind; <em>Please, try to be calm. Such reactions are echoes from the world you left behind. Here, in Nirvana, all spirits are to be cherished and guided with kindness.</em> </p>\n<p>\"Shut up!\" the Halfling snarled.</p>\n<p>At the party's confusion, she shared the message telepathically, shaking in anger. That demon! How dare it! She fought to stoke her anger and keep it burning. She had to be furious, because fear was encroaching on the edges of her anger. She could not let her suspicions take form. Oh goddess, these were an angel's words. A demon would not know or care about the River of Souls, or Nirvana. It was an angel's voice. Not again, please, not again. Naami realised she was shaking too much to treat her friend's wounds. Shalkoc stepped in next to her, and with a gentle nod to Naami, cast a healing spell on Aviana. The wordless help brought her close to tears.</p>\n<p>The voice spoke in reply to Shalkoc's spell: <em>How wonderful! Your spirit already resonates with the compassion that flows through Nirvana. Such kindness is a true sign of your innate goodness.</em></p>\n<p>\"Oh, thank you,\" Shalkoc says. \"We could be friends!\"</p>\n<p>Aviana agreed, but Fearghas snapped at Aviana, Shalkoc, and Plex.</p>\n<p>\"Have you three not been paying attention? You've been running amok since we arrived here, teleporting all over the place. We are fighting for our lives here! That thing is a demon! It is not a friend! It warps the very bodies and minds of its prey. Naami told you what it does, and look how traumatised she is! No one is going to hit you any more, Aviana. We need you in fighting shape.\"</p>\n<p>\"But my spirit is all down, I need someone to slap some sense into me. Someone weak, not you Shalkoc, your punches hit like a boulder.\"</p>\n<p>Fearghas rubbed his temples with deliberate slowness. Emilio stared in utter confusion as Aviana continued to argue that it was truly a power she possessed, although she did not understand how it worked. With a carefully blank expression, Fearghas handed out healing potions, which seemed to finally stop this madness. The insanity only continued in the shape of the voice congratulating Aviana and Plex on a friendly trade of copper coins for a bottle of what could only be bright green snot.</p>\n<p>\"Naami, out of curiosity,\" Fearghas said in a weary voice, \"was the one you met before like this?\"</p>\n<p>\"It wasn't… I've suspected for a while, this isn't the demon talking. It's too long a game for a demon to play… they don't act like that.\"</p>\n<p>\"So that demon took control of a celestial?\" Emilio said.</p>\n<p>\"Or worse,\" Naami said, shaking.</p>\n<p>She tried to drown her fear in familiar motions, applying healing salve to Aviana's wounds and to her own. It was not as good as magic but… her magic, her life force, was limited. She had to hold onto it for when there would be no time for slower forms of healing. As she worked, the emotions faded to the background, her attention fully on the motions of her fingers, but there was only so much salve she could apply to any wound. The thoughts came back the moment she was done, and this time she was powerless to silence them.</p>\n<p>\"It's really an angel,\" Naami said, her voice distant in her ears. \"It's trapped here, and deceived.\"</p>\n<p>Summoned by the words, memories came rushing back into her mind. Her hands rose unbidden to her head, tangling into her hair. She tried to close her eyes, but it was worse. Opening them to the same nightmare that haunted her made her want to scream. She only managed a whimper. \"Not again, not again, not again…\" Seeming to materialise out of the shadows, Emilio appeared beside her. His voice sank into a soft whisper, unlike even the reserved personality he had shown until now. Despite a splinter of cold in his voice, it was reassuring.</p>\n<p>\"Don't let them get you,\" he said. \"You are who you are, no matter what.\"</p>\n<p>His eyes were drawn to movement in front of him, as Fearghas pulled a heavy tome from his pack. Complex patterns on the covers were shifting, and the entire book seemed to hum. Naami looked up to see Fearghas calmly skimming through the book, its pages covered in a tight script alternating with maps that seemed to move as she tilted her head. Star charts? She had used them before, to gather herbs during the right phases of the moon, but the charts she had seen did not twist and change under her eyes…</p>\n<p>Next to her, Emilio went stiff as a statue, glaring at the spellbook in the dwarf's hands. His bandaged hands twitched, he seemed to shudder, and… he changed. Darkness like ink spilled into the white of his eyes, leaving the purple irises glowing in a sea of blackness. The bandages burst, revealing wicked claws set with a glowing purple gem like an eye, wrapped in crackling energy. With a squeak, the tiny Plex summoned his telekinesis and shoved Emilio out of the protection of Fearghas' spell.</p>\n<p>\"What in the nine hells?\" Fearghas exclaimed. \"Emilio, what happened to you?\"</p>\n<p>\"Nothing. This is my true form.\" Emilio's voice had a rough, cold edge.</p>\n<p>\"Was this the secret you were keeping from us?\" Naami said, face pale.</p>\n<p>\"Maybe it was.\"</p>\n<p>\"What <em>are</em> you?\" She cried.</p>\n<p>\"I think we have more urgent matters to deal with,\" the warlock growled.</p>\n<p>An awkward silence stretched before Fearghas admitted, reluctantly, that he was right. Unfazed, Shalkoc offered to cook some food for Aviana, who immediately asked for a spicy snack. At the utter lack of concern from his friends, Fearghas beckoned Emilio back into the protective bubble.</p>\n<p>\"We need to make sure Emilio doesn't attack us, right?\" Aviana said in the middle of discussing chilies with Shalkoc.</p>\n<p>\"If I wanted you dead, you would be,\" he said, his black and purple eyes showing no emotion. \"Besides… we need to get rid of whatever is in control here, <em>fast</em>. The tunnels are already changing.\"</p>\n<p>He pointed at the warped tunnel behind him, twisted into nothing like the place the party had entered from.</p>\n<p>\"T-that's what they do,\" Naami stammered. \"They change the corridors… just like last time…\"</p>\n<p>\"That's not all,\" Plex said. \"My curse… is silent here.\"</p>\n<p>Fearghas went very still. Naami felt the magic around him shift, just subtly, without forming a spell. The two wizards exchanged a look, then Fearghas spoke:</p>\n<p>\"Teleportation magic will not work here. Or planar travel.\"</p>\n<p>\"We're trapped here?\" Naami squeaked.</p>\n<p>\"Well, we can't run away,\" Fearghas said.</p>\n<p>With a sigh, the party settled down to rest. There was little else they could do, after all. Naami sat very gingerly on the repulsive floor, trying to avoid the pulsating parts. She found a patch that seemed less squishy and, doing her utmost to ignore the resemblance with scar tissue, sat cross-legged for just a moment. Her arms still stung from the rush of uncontrolled magic she had directed at Plex; borne on her fear for her friend, the magic had taken her blood as fuel to heal the goblin. Not a lot of thinking had been involved; she had been too far for a spell that was safe for her, and he had been too injured for a weaker spell. Healing… sometimes, healing also meant hurting. Absentmindedly, she drew her dagger, the sharper of the two she carried. The other dagger was forged with magic, but this one was simply of extraordinary quality. It had a long handle formed to fit her hand, and a single-edged blade ending in a sharp tip, an unusual form for a dagger. Oh, she could probably pick a lock or disable a trap with it, not that she knew much of such things, but she would be loath to use this fine a blade in such a crude fashion. The needle point, the razor edge, they were for cutting through skin and muscle. It would slice through tendons with ease, requiring little force as long as her fingers were deft enough to guide the blade to the weaker spots of her target's body. Naami's weapon was a dagger only by name; it was the only weapon a healer needed, a surgeon's blade. She had had it forged at great cost, worth every copper, and she would have paid more if that meant she had it sooner. Her eyes lingered over the perfect edge without seeing it. If only she had had it sooner.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>She had been carried out of a snowstorm and into the relative warmth of an inn, the weak fire on the hearth seeming a blaze of the ninth hell to her frozen limbs. Thoughts slow with cold, she sat close to the flames, dimly remembering to move her toes and fingers. Feeling returned in the form of needles; she gritted her teeth and continued. The alternative did not bear thinking of. As if in answer to her thoughts, the door banged open, letting in howling wind and snow.</p>\n<p>\"Close that door, man!\" Daman snapped at the newcomer.</p>\n<p>\"Healer!\" the man cried, ignoring the door and Daman. \"You have a healer?\"</p>\n<p>Before she knew it, Naami had pushed herself to her feet. Osten was at her side with a steadying hand.</p>\n<p>\"Easy, you still need rest,\" he murmured.</p>\n<p>It warmed her heart, if not her flesh, but she could not stop herself.</p>\n<p>\"I am a healer,\" she said as she tottered to the man.</p>\n<p>He gave her a dubious look, but desperation was stronger than doubt. Not awaiting the innkeeper's permission, he deposited his burden on a nearby table. Wrapped in rags and furs was a boy barely out of childhood, his eyes closed, frost clinging to his eyelashes.</p>\n<p>\"My son,\" the man sobbed. \"We were caught in the blizzard. Frostbite. Please help him, and all I own is yours.\"</p>\n<p>Naami shook her head; she had no need for such promises. She was who she was. Running her hands over the boy, she summoned weak magic to examine him. Having closed the door, Magnus joined her, brushing icicles from his beard. They soon reached the same conclusion.</p>\n<p>\"His life force is tainted,\" Magnus muttered.</p>\n<p>\"Disrupted,\" Naami agreed.</p>\n<p>She said no more out loud, to not frighten the father any more than he was, but Magnus and her knew the boy's condition was severe. Naami gave instructions; Osten helped drag the table closer to the fire while Daman fetched a tub of water. He waved his fingers over it, heating it to boiling in a flash of magic. Gently, Naami and Magnus removed the boy's boots and several layers of wool socks. The right boot was torn at the front, the socks cold and damp. Naami took out some of her herbs, her heart sinking. Even before seeing the boy's blackened toes, she knew herbs would do no good.</p>\n<p>She tried. With Magnus' help and his control over fire, his fine perception of life itself, she tried. She rubbed the boy's feet with a salve and bathed them in warm water. When it failed, she summoned her magic, carefully at first. She was all too aware of her trembling legs, of the cold still trapped under her own skin. Magnus' magic supported hers, a current of warmth and strength under her unsteady weaves. Osten had firmly dragged the boy's father to the side and was distracting him to the best of his ability. Naami was not listening, but her friend's strong voice helped settle her nerves. Daman sat on a stool like it was a throne, observing, keeping watch on the magic itself, a notepad resting on the table before him. Naami wove magic into a simple healing spell, one to invigorate the patient and restore blood flow. The spell sank into the boy's body, but the cold was stronger. She gathered her strength for a spell of higher power, ready to melt the cold within his flesh. Magnus' only hand brushed against her arm.</p>\n<p>\"That's too risky,\" he said in a whisper, glancing at the father. \"There is still a flicker of life there, but the two last toes are dead.\"</p>\n<p>With a start, Naami let go of her spell without completing it. Her friend was right. She should have known. She would have known, if she had not been so cold and so tired. The Halfling bit her lip hard, willing for the pain to restore her concentration. She could not afford to mess this up. The father's anxious, short replies to Osten's chatter intruded into her concentration. The boy's shallow breathing was suddenly louder to her ears. His eyelids trembled, then opened to reveal hazel eyes clouded with confusion.</p>\n<p>\"Where am I?\" he said. \"Where is Dad?\"</p>\n<p>\"Your Da's right here, lad,\" Magnus said warmly. \"You'll be able to talk to him in a bit. Just be a little patient.\"</p>\n<p>\"I can't feel my toes,\" the boy whined.</p>\n<p>\"I know it's very scary,\" Magnus said, \"but we're gonna do our best to help.\"</p>\n<p>The dwarf glanced at Naami. She made herself meet his eyes.</p>\n<p>\"You're right,\" she said, her words strangled. \"It's too late.\"</p>\n<p>Using magic would only poison his blood and kill him in minutes. The only hope for the boy's life was to cut off the dead flesh, and heal what still had a chance to be healed. Naami ignored the painful churning in her stomach; she had to think of the practical side. With Magnus' help, she thoroughly examined the boy. Only two of the toes on his right foot were beyond saving. Two toes, on a boy whose voice had not dropped yet… No. Only two toes. He could recover from this, if he survived the procedure.</p>\n<p>\"Osten, we're gonna need space,\" she said, voice void of emotion.</p>\n<p>The knight understood the message, and began leading the father away to the rooms on the first floor. There were protests, the innkeeper got involved, and Naami ignored all of it. She prepared more herbs, salves to stop bleeding, salves to protect from infection, and one mix that would send anyone into a deathlike sleep. Her hands shook only a little as she prepared the mixture, and coaxed the boy to drink it. When he was lying senseless on the table, and she had clean cloth and bandages ready, Naami took a deep breath. Her dagger was plain, the blade nicked, but it would have to do. She hesitated, then also removed her spellwards. Magnus shot her a glare.</p>\n<p>\"If you use this magic, you'll die,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"And if I don't, he will die.\"</p>\n<p>The dwarf exhaled explosively, frustration turning to anger.</p>\n<p>\"I can't tell you what to do,\" he growled, \"but have a care for your own life.\"</p>\n<p>\"I am! I can do this!\"</p>\n<p>Daman looked up from the notes he was taking, face blank.</p>\n<p>\"Magnus is right, Naami. Don't be reckless. You can't save everyone.\"</p>\n<p>\"I can't if I don't try,\" she said between clenched teeth. \"And I'm not alone anyway. Magnus can use healing magic too.\"</p>\n<p>\"I can't heal death,\" he muttered.</p>\n<p>\"No one can,\" Daman snapped. \"Sometimes there is nothing to do.\"</p>\n<p>\"But not now,\" Naami said softly, as if to herself. \"Now there is still a chance for this family, so let me take it.\"</p>\n<p>Daman shrugged and returned to his scribing. Magnus gave Naami a level look.</p>\n<p>\"You better be sure of yourself, lass. The only thing I'm really asking you is, don't make your friends sad. Don't break your family to save strangers.\"</p>\n<p>\"I won't.\"</p>\n<p>\"Then let's be about it,\" he sighed.</p>\n<p>Naami completed the preparations; cleaning up as much as possible, and asking Magnus to prepare certain spells. She hardly needed to say what she wanted him to do; they had worked together for some time. She stalled as much as she dared, but the inevitable moment came when she held the point of her dagger on the boy's skin. She aimed at the joint between the bones, the weakest point. She let magic fill her mind to calm her nerves, then leaned on the dagger with all her weight.</p>\n<p>The blade sank into flesh and remained stuck. Gritting her teeth, ignoring the boy's whining through the sleeping draught, she whacked the dagger's pommel. It took two more tries before it bit into the wood with a thud. Despite Magnus' magic, the bleeding was already severe. There was simply no time. She applied the blade to the second toe, trying to wish more strength into her arms. It took only two tries then, but the cuts were uneven, the edges mangled by the chipped blade. Dropping the dagger, she set to weaving a healing spell. There was so much blood. The boy's face grew bone-white, his whimpers fading into silence. Naami summoned more power into her spell, power to knit wounds and restore life force. In the urgency of the moment, she paid no mind to the flood of magic rushing through her. She only rarely took off her spellwards, and in a crisis she acted on instinct fuelled by training and habit. Her spell blossomed into a torrent of positive energy, closing the wounds in a heartbeat. The boy's breathing steadied, colour returned to his cheeks. Dimly, Naami heard Magnus curse in tones of awe. She knew what he must be seeing; she felt it, a tiny circle of life with power over death, between her and the child. Life flowed from her into him, and the cold in his flesh lost ground until it was gone. She knew that in a sense, she had taken the shadow of death from him, and settled it on her instead. She knew that, and all the light around her was swallowed in a tide of silent darkness.</p>\n<p>Naami awoke to a lumpy mattress and scratchy blankets. When she tried to raise her head, the small room spun around her. Voices came from the corridor, one angry and the other soothing.</p>\n<p>\"… told her! The idiot! She hardly controls her magic without those bracelets, but she had to!\"</p>\n<p>\"She had to, and you know it.\"</p>\n<p>\"She can die for all I care! Burn herself out with that magic!\"</p>\n<p>\"You don't mean that, Magnus.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mean it! That's easy for you to say! You can't see the weaves. The sheer amount of power she pulled into herself… do you have <em>any</em> idea…?\"</p>\n<p>An uncomfortable silence. Then Osten replied, in a much quieter voice, \"No, I don't. But she is alive, and so is the boy.\"</p>\n<p>Boots thudded on the floor, then the door opened, letting the tall knight in.</p>\n<p>\"Naami.\" He rushed to her side and knelt by her bed. \"How do you feel?\"</p>\n<p>\"Like an idiot?\" she said, the words refusing to come out quite right.</p>\n<p>\"I suppose you would,\" Osten chuckled. \"Don't mind Magnus. He is only frightened for you. When you fainted, he panicked.\"</p>\n<p>\"He… is right,\" she said reluctantly. \"It was foolish. Reckless. I was a fool.\"</p>\n<p>\"If you know it, that's a step in the right direction. Just make sure the next step follows suit.\"</p>\n<p>She nodded, her thoughts sluggish. Osten told her that the boy was alive and well, that he would walk again, if with a cane or a prosthetic. The father had burst into tears and sworn before the gods to pay with all he owned, cradling his boy. Daman had wanted to accept before Osten stepped in. Naami stared at the ceiling, listening with one ear. Her hands hurt with the memory of cutting the boy's toes; she feared she would be sick. The frayed edges of the wounds haunted her mind. It had all worked out in the end, but only because she had put her own life in danger. She hoped there would never be another situation like this one. She knew it was foolish hope, a dangerous wish. What she needed was time to recover her strength, and right after that, a new dagger. A sharper one.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Sharp pain brought Naami's mind back to the present, to the nightmare she was trapped in. She looked down to a nicked finger, and a drop of red on her sharp dagger. She fought down the urge to giggle as she cleaned the small cut; she feared her laugh might escape her control and spin into a mad cackle. She hoped they would make it out alive. No. She hoped they would destroy that demon, and she hoped her hand would be the one to end it. Her staff spoke of forgiveness; she recalled the dawn of the day she had found it, and the soothing cooing of doves. Her crime was forgiven, but the stain on her soul refused to fade, enduring in nightmares and breathless moments of panic. Redemption, she thought, was not a one-time thing; it was a choice, and she wanted to make that choice as many times as she could.</p>\n<p>She sheathed her blade, remembering with a shudder that she had threatened a friend with it. She could not lose her nerve again. Naami patiently put herself through the breathing exercises that were part of Ildic witches' training. Her mind strayed, but she brought it back to the task every time. It was not foolish to have hope. It was not! As long as she also expected the worst.</p>\n<p>As in answer to her grim thought, the gentle voice spoke in everyone's minds: <em>Rest now, little spirits, you've just navigated the currents of the River of Souls. It's not uncommon to feel a little bewildered upon arrival. All is well here.</em> And as if on cue, the shining darkness crept closer.</p>"

          "content": "<p>The nightmare was different this time. As Naami slipped into a fitful sleep in one of the tower's cosy guest rooms, she expected to find herself in the cavern again, defenceless before her fear. She stood in darkness but it was the natural gloom of a deep cave instead of the painful magic-wrought darkness. It was similar to one of the caverns she had traversed with Matron Vandree's party; a high roof made a dome above her head, pierced with stalactites like giant teeth ready to bite down. A dark moss carpeted the rock and a wild array of mushrooms grew close to the walls, fed by dripping water. A purple fungus grew halfway to the roof, its stalks tough as wood. To one of these trunks, the dark shape of a male Drow was nailed by his wrists. His body hung limp as he struggled to breathe, growing weaker by the second.</p>\n<p>\"Madr!\" Naami cried and reached out to her friend.</p>\n<p>His eyes glittered with hate. Blood trickled from his mouth.</p>\n<p>\"Traitor,\" he spat. \"Did we not take care of you? Protect you? You <em>had</em> to run to your kin of cowering surface-dwellers!\"</p>\n<p>\"I was all but a slave,\" she cried. \"I said I would free you. I can save you, too!\"</p>\n<p>She tried to get close to him but chains wrapped around her neck, and around her bare wrists. The sooty links were driven into the ground, anchored as solidly as if they had grown out of the rock. She struggled, but the cold metal only bit into her skin. Above her Madr's body convulsed, blood flowing out of his mouth now. His eyes closed as his face contorted with pain. Against her better judgement, Naami tried to raise her hands, tried to form the pattern in the Weave that would heal him. She could see the magic, although dimly. The chains dragged her down, draining her strength. If she could manage just one spell, she could save him. Screaming in frustration, fighting her shackles, she called the magic with all her might. It had always been here, an unseen force that would crash into her mind if she so much as thought of it. It would not deny her now! The cold radiated up from her wrists to her shoulders; her fingers went numb. The chain strangled her, now she too was fighting for air but Naami was no stranger to battles anymore. She tasted blood but her spell was taking shape, just another thread of magic and she could release it, seek out Madr's wounds and close them. She could save him. She could save everyone.</p>\n<p>The Drow cried out as white wings burst from his back, wide and brilliant in the gloom. His face was no longer his, the sharpness of his features smoothed into a celestial's perfect beauty. Eyes of pure light gazed down on her, filled with worry and pain.</p>\n<p>\"I can help you, little candle,\" the winged man said in a caressing tone. \"I can teach you to become a better healer.\"</p>\n<p>\"No!\" Naami shrieked.</p>\n<p>Her tenuous control over magic slipped and she released her spell. Knowing what would happen did not make it any easier. The celestial had worn Madr's face just a minute ago, but his body flashed into a tortured ruin, a mockery of what an angel had been. The spell closed mortal wounds, only for the skin to burst a moment later, spilling blood, torn entrails, and maggots. Held by her chains, Naami could only scream and writhe as her hands were splashed with blood, as squirming shapes climbed up her legs. Slicing through her screams a voice reached her, cold as a poison-coated blade.</p>\n<p>\"Traitor,\" Matron Vandree said, her silhouette looming in the shadows. \"You have chosen your fate, and the spider goddess has blessed me with the duty to deliver you onto it.\"</p>\n<p>\"I healed your people!\" Naami cried. \"I offered my blood and my life force to close your wounds!\"</p>\n<p>\"Only to plot to kill us all,\" she laughed, a joyless sound more akin to that of a blade being drawn. \"How pointless. Is it the same with your surface-dweller <em>friends</em>? Do you also heal them, only for them to run back into the fight and get injured again? Why do you try? Why do you pay the cost in blood, time and again, for nothing to change?\"</p>\n<p>\"Because that's who I am.\" Naami could not blame the chain around her neck for the pain in her throat, the stabbing heat of a lump announcing tears.</p>\n<p>\"Useless,\" the Matron sneered. \"All you do is undone. Give up. After betraying me, there is nothing left for you anyway.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're wrong!\"</p>\n<p>She smiled; it was a threat. \"Why don't you scream how wrong I am? But will anyone hear you?\"</p>\n<p>Naami's resolve flared; on the edge of delivering a biting response she saw the Matron lift her arm, fingers hooking around threads of magic. She uttered words of such power, Naami's bones hummed with it. Then all went black, vision and hearing swallowed by humid warmth and the overpowering stench of decay. Before she even touched the inner shell of a slimy egg, before her flesh began to spasm and change, she knew where she was; back in the Sibriex' lair, being warped into a monster, and she would not have Kyrin's luck. She screamed then, screamed until her throat was raw and her head spun, screamed until the darkness seized her and she slumped inside the black egg, her skin bulging in agony. She howled, and there was nobody to hear her.</p>\n<p>Naami screamed herself awake and twisted out of the sweat-soaked sheets, brutally landing on the rug next to her bed. She lay on her back, eyes darting as she tried to catch her breath. The reek of blood and decay lingered in her nose; her fingertips still felt slimy. She grabbed at her throat, and could not stifle a relieved sob when she found no chain there. Her spellwards were snug on her wrists, a familiar coolness on her clammy skin. She drank in the quiet of the tower. She was safe here, was she not?</p>\n<p>A bang at her door made her jump near out of her skin. She lay in the dimness, panting as quietly as she could, unable to move for her life. She listened with all her being but after a short moment, a familiar voice spoke.</p>\n<p>\"Naami? You're awake?\"</p>\n<p>It was Aviana's voice. Naami tried to stand twice but her legs would not let her. She had to settle for slumping on the rug, draped in her blanket.</p>\n<p>\"Yes. Um… Sorry if I woke you?\"</p>\n<p>\"It's alright. Are you okay? I heard a noise.\"</p>\n<p>Naami gathered her courage for a confident reply. She would give a little giggle and dismiss it as a dream and the harpy would laugh, maybe tease her, and be on her way. It would be as if none of this had happened. All she had to do was wave a hand and smile. She would climb back into bed, and go back to sleep.</p>\n<p>\"I had a nightmare,\" Naami said in a tiny voice, barely swallowing a sob.</p>\n<p>A pause, then: \"Can I come in?\"</p>\n<p>Naami gave a squeak in assent. The door swung open, admitting the harpy. Aviana sat on the rug next to her, her dark wings making the small room feel crowded. Naami reached out to brush the feathers, her hands shaking. In the darkness she could not see where the dark grey feathers turned to deep blue, but it was enough to know they were not white. Her stomach turned at the memory of brilliant white wings. How much longer would she suffer those nightmares? She had overcome her fear! She had defeated the monster in the Sibriex' lair!</p>\n<p>With a lot of care, Aviana put one hand on Naami's head, her sharp talons curling away. The Halfling gave a surprised start, but at the first clumsy head pat the tension began to drain from her shoulders. Aviana's careful touch made her skin tingle; the friendly gesture, if awkward, was immensely calming. She realised her jaw ached from grinding her teeth, and made herself stop.</p>\n<p>\"The bravest of us have nightmares,\" Aviana said wisely. \"Sometimes even when we are awake. Often, they're called Plex.\"</p>\n<p>The Halfling giggled in spite of herself. Oh, she was still shaky, still haunted by the horrifying visions. But Aviana's words… they were real. Her friend was real, and they would protect each other.</p>\n<p>\"And sometimes, even Plex disappears,\" the harpy went on. \"So nothing is so scary it lasts forever! Until Plex comes back, I suppose… Better to focus on the good things. I've only ever seen you in the green dress, do you have a blue one? Deep blue, like my feathers, that would <em>really</em> compliment your eyes, and it would go well with the bracelets you always wear.\"</p>\n<p>\"I do have another travelling dress,\" Naami said, her voice becoming steadier. \"It's more of a light blue, though.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well that will hardly do,\" Aviana sniffed, dead serious. \"We <em>do</em> need to go shopping some time. I also need another mug.\"</p>\n<p>\"Didn't Fearghas just buy you a mug?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" she admitted, patiently drawing out the word, \"but he bought it from the <em>Duergar</em>. Who knows how it was made. Probably by slaves. How unethical! It will make my drinks taste of low morality. And then my skin will get all dull. You need to pay attention to these things.\"</p>\n<p>Tears rose to Naami's eyes faster than she could stifle them. She was blubbering before she had a chance to calm herself. Hearing Aviana's usual talk, as if nightmares had no power on her, on the world… the sense of relief was just too powerful for her shredded nerves. She wiped her eyes, only bringing out more tears. She grieved for the celestials, she feared for Madr and for her friends, but above all she relished Aviana's lively presence, she delighted in being alive and well herself. Angels or demons would not break her. She had powerful allies she could rely on, and they were becoming dear friends too. Neither the Drow nor the Duergar would stop her. She would find out what was happening in Ildilas, and she would go home and see her parents. She could introduce them to her friends!</p>\n<p>\"There, Naamilia. It's okay,\" Aviana said, her usually flamboyant voice dropped to a soothing whisper.</p>\n<p>She draped one wing over Naami's shoulders. Silky feathers brushed the Halfling's skin, a cool caress and an occasional tickle. How had Aviana come up with this nickname? It didn't matter. Naami reached out for a hug, her hands growing steadier. Aviana hugged her back with great care, as if she was made of brittle glass. To the harpy's strength, she probably was even more fragile than glass. Beneath skin unmarred by scars, thanks to potions and magic, Aviana's muscles were steel. Even as she sat with her legs casually crossed, comforting a friend, she had the aura of a force of nature. She was a rock, steadfast and immovable, unlike the boulders she liked to move. There was no place safer than Aviana's arms in this moment.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you,\" the healer said.</p>\n<p>\"For what?\"</p>\n<p>\"Everything. Not abandoning me to the Drow. For keeping me away from Dimzad and his chains. Even though I've only put you all in greater danger now.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ah, nonsense. There is always danger for people like us. Where is the fun, without a good arm wrestling session?\"</p>\n<p>\"Speak for yourself,\" Naami giggled. \"You have so much muscle.\"</p>\n<p>\"It makes my charm,\" Aviana said. \"And you have… <em>negative</em> muscle, really. You are eating meat? And plenty of soup?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes mum,\" Naami teased. \"I'm just naturally small.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hmmm. Doesn't hurt to make sure. I'll ask Shalkoc to cook a healthy breakfast for you. Dawn shouldn't be too far, now.\"</p>\n<p>In the windowless room, it was impossible to be sure. Naami stood gingerly but her legs were steady enough for a dance now. She could not resist a little hop and a skip out of the room, to prove she could. She was not afraid anymore. In the tower's main hall, a pale light touched the high windows, making the floor tiles gleam. Motes of dust glittered in the air, reminding Naami to tease Fearghas about cleaning up the place. Soon her friends would wake up, and they would all gather for breakfast. The nightmare would really be gone then, dispelled by daylight and the party's noise, by hot tea and sweet treats. It would come back; Naami was certain of it. Confronting her fear was not the same as healing from it. When the nightmare returned she would be ready to face it again, as many times as it took. Aviana took her leave to be about her morning stretches; left to herself, Naami gave her face a thorough wash, and changed into her blue dress.</p>"

Though the transition was not unfamiliar, something about it this time felt unsettling, as if the very essence of the realm had shifted.</p><p>When he opened his eyes, the usual kaleidoscope of vibrant, overwhelming colors did not greet him. Instead, a strange dullness had taken hold of the landscape, as though the world around him was slowly fading, its once brilliant hues bleeding away into shades of gray.</p><p>For a day, perhaps two, Plex wandered through this muted wilderness. He gathered curious and rare materials, though the joy of discovery felt unusually distant. Eventually, as he crossed a shimmering river, he encountered a Nereid.</p><p>It was Aranei, a familiar figure from Mennon's court, her uncanny beauty seeming diminished in this colorless light. She spoke of a strange veil that had descended upon Mennon’s palace and the surrounding lands—a veil that sapped not only color but also joy from everything it touched. The court had fallen into disarray, and the Dark Hunt, had been postponed indefinitely. \"Far more pressing matters claim our attention now,\" Mennon had said in an unusually cryptic tone, laced with urgency.</p><p>Those of lesser strength within the court had been urged to flee, and Aranei had done so, retreating into the wild rivers she called home. As she fled, she noticed with dread that the veil was expanding, creeping outward like a living thing, muting colors, light, and joy as it spread.</p><p>Before Aranei could finish her tale, Plex felt the familiar tug of planar magic once again.

          "content": "<h2>Meeting Familiar Faces</h2><p>One moment Plex was in the middle of adjusting his gear, grumbling to himself about the ever-present dust in the lich's former lair, and the next—a hefty sneeze exploded from him. In that instant, the curse took hold, twisting reality around him in a familiar, disorienting flash.</p><p>The ground beneath his feet vanished, and with a jolt, he found himself standing amidst the chaotic beauty of the Feywild. It wasn’t his first time, nor would it likely be the last, but the sudden teleportation left him cursing the fates as he stumbled through the colourful, shifting landscape. The fact that the world around him was full of colour and life, and not covered in a grey veil like it had been the last time, was a relieving realisation.</p><p>After several days of wandering, his aimless journey brought him to a vast lake, its waters a shimmering cascade of colours that reflected the ever-changing skies above. At its center, a town floated on the lake's surface—an intricate network of platforms and bridges, held aloft by some ancient magic. The town was mostly inhabited by elves, their buildings graceful and elegant, seeming to glide with the gentle waves. Curious and with little else to do, Plex swam his way over to the town.</p><p>It was there that he encountered Antx and Prantx. The goblin twins had arrived just a few days before him and were lingering at the edge of town, trying to stay out of sight of the more suspicious elves. The town’s residents hadn’t been too keen on allowing the goblins to remain, seeing them as troublemakers who didn’t belong among their refined society. But after some tense negotiations, Prantx had managed to convince the elves to let them stay, offering his skills as a blacksmith in exchange for shelter. His craftsmanship was impressive enough to win them a begrudging place within the floating community.</p><p>When Plex approached them, the two goblins were quick to strike up a deal, exchanging a few small trinkets they had acquired during their travels in return for some basic supplies Plex had been carrying. It was after the trade that the twins shared their story of a recent incident with him.</p><h2>The Brothers' Story</h2><p>Antx and Prantx described the strange series of events with a certain level of disbelief, as if recounting a fevered dream that hadn't yet faded from their minds.</p><p>It had started when they got teleported into a region of the Feywild that wasn’t like anything they had ever seen before. The air was thick with a mist that seemed alive. It wasn’t like ordinary fog—this mist clung to everything, swallowing the vibrant colours that normally defined the Feywild. The greens of the trees, the brilliant blues of the sky, even the shimmering hues of their own skin seemed to fade. The world around them became dull, bleached of its usual lustre.</p><p>In the middle of this eerie, washed-out landscape, they found it—a lantern, standing alone amidst the fog. It was old and weathered, but something about it drew them in. There was a sensation, a pull, like the lantern was whispering to them, calling them closer. Neither of them could explain why, but they felt compelled to touch it.</p><p>The moment their hands made contact, the world twisted around them, folding in on itself. The colours that had been drained from the surroundings seemed to rush inward, converging on the lantern, before exploding into a blinding flash of light. When the light faded, they were no longer in the Feywild.</p><p>Instead, they found themselves in a clearing unlike anything they had ever known. The trees were twisted and dead, their branches brittle and sharp like claws against the perpetually dim sky. Above them hung a full moon, heavy and cold, but there were no stars, no sun—just an endless night. And no matter how much time passed, the moon remained still, locked in its position high above.</p><p>The clearing itself was small and unnervingly quiet. At its centre stood another lantern, eerily similar to the one they had touched. Unlike the lantern in the Feywild, this one didn’t drain colours. It was still, almost tranquil, but as they watched, a small, flickering mote of light formed within it. The mote wasn’t like the dim glow of the moon—it was vivid, almost painfully so, as if it had taken all the stolen colours of the Feywild and concentrated them into this single point of light.</p><p>Without hesitation, the mote drifted out of the lantern and began to float toward the forest, moving slowly but purposefully. It was the only thing that seemed alive in this dead, barren place. Antx and Prantx had considered following it, but the dark, oppressive forest felt too vast, too filled with unknown dangers.</p><p>Before they could make a decision, their curse took hold. Instinctively, both brothers reached out to the lantern on the clearing and held onto it, even though they knew full well it wouldn't stop the teleportation. Then they were ripped away from that strange clearing, transported back to the Feywild in what seemed like an instant. The moment they appeared again, the vibrant colours of the Feywild flooded their senses, and the oppressive feeling of the dead forest faded, though the memory of it lingered.</p><p>To their surprise, two were still holding onto the lantern they had just grabbed. After making sure it wasn't draining any colours from them, they decided to hold onto it to give it to someone who might know better what to do with it. And so they were relieved to meet Plex - after all, who else could have been better suited for such a task than the wise shaman of their tribe?</p>"

Mennon is annoyed since few of the creatures living around Titania's court welcome him, and they are making his search unnecessary difficult. Therefore he wants Plex, who is less known to sneak in and search for her. as a thanks he will let Plex borrow two of his new servants, Antx and Parnatx. </p><p>So Plex and his two tribe members travel towards the court of Titania. On there way Plex, Antx and Parnatx, discuss the the ritual that bound Antx and Parnatx together and the curse Elsa placed on them. Apparently the curse have started to become stronger, and are now teleporting Antx and Parnatx to other planes as well. For strategic reasons they therefor decided to try to also bind Plex to the two of them to increase their chanse of survival. However, it doesn't go as planed and the ritual fails multiple times during several Sleep cycles before they have to give up on the idea. It wasn't all for naught tho, since during there experimentation Plex manages to cook up a new spell instead. </p><p>A while later they arrive in a happy field in Titania court, filled with Pink and red flowers. Through the field cuts a luminous river that blocks the trios path. However the other side of the river is suspiciously quiet which worries Plex. They decides to follow the river, searching for a safer place to cross the river, when they come to a small settlement of frog-like creatures. Plex is greeted by a tribe of Bagiennik (a race of toad people with innate healing abilities concentrated in their snot) that are camping by the riverside. </p><p>They explain that they are searching for a white flower with innate healing abilities, but they are equally worried about the foreboding silence up ahead. They ask the trio to fetch the flowers for them and in return they are willing to share some of their magic knowledge.The trio agree and heads out into the silent field, picking white flowers, when Plex notices that the field is littered with patches of withered and frozen flowers.</p><p>He doesn't have much time to speculate on it tho, as they are suddenly ambushed by a group of Calpinas (insect like creatures who eat charisma form their pray) . The trio manages to fend of the insects and even capture one of them. After some interrogation Plex learns that the insects uses the magical flowers as a lure to catch unsuspecting pray. And that their numbers used to be much higher before they made the critical mistake to attack a Hag with her entourage that passed through, which Plex assumes was Elsa.</p><p>Plex also learned that soon thereafter almost no creatures entered the fields agin leaving them starving. But before Plex could squeeze out any more information, Antx and Parnatx disappeared, which gave the Calpina an opportunity to escape. Returning to the frog people with the magical flowers Plex was rewarded with a new feat and some bottles of snot.Here he also learned that there was no reason to search for Titania, as she and her entire court had diapered a while back. </p><p>Armed with the new information Plex heads back towards Mennon, but he is distracted by a \"Lantern goat\" (a goat that uses its lantern to lure and capture nearby souls on there way to the afterlife for consumption), that crosses his path. Plex hasn't given up on the idea to have a goat as his personal spy. So in an attempt to capture the goat, Plex sets up a trap and prepares a big net, readying himself to ambush the lantern goat. As the goat walks in to his trap Plex leaps towards the goat and tries to grab its horns. [and then he leaves the Fey-wilds]</p>"

While some might be willing to climb through a window, fewer would be willing to pay for it.

After evading the guards for a while, naturally causing more chaos on the way, he noticed a black raven circling above and seemingly following him. Distracted by having to dodge an oar swung at him by a fisher who was not happy to see Plex standing in the middle of his catch, Plex lost sight of the raven for a moment.</p><p>Minutes later, after momentarily shaking off his pursuers, he found himself inside a narrow alleyway when the black raven appeared again. This time the animal landed next to Plex and dropped a piece of parchment it had been carrying in his beak in front of Plex's feet before flying away again.</p><p>When Plex read the parchment he watched as the ink lifted itself off the page, flew towards his spellbook, and inscribed a new spell into it, all in the blink of an eye. Only very little ink remained on the parchment of the scroll, spelling out the words: \"A little token of appreciation from a fellow admirer of chaos.

          "content": "<p>Just as Aviana's hand closed around Plex's neck, the goblin's curse took hold once more and transported him into the Feywild - only for Aviana's curse to take hold as well and bring her along.</p><p>The two appeared in the middle of a clearing in a vibrant forest, and surrounded by a few dozen Satyrs who're dancing, drinking, playing music, and partying. Their music suddenly stopped however once they got interrupted by Plex's choking gasps for air and Aviana's \"Listen here you little shit...\".</p><p>The satyrs clearly weren't amused and what followed was an honest effort of diplomacy from Aviana. Which was interrupted only briefly when she noticed that she was still holding Plex aloft by his throat, and that this particular image probably wasn't helping her diplomatic efforts. So she let the goblin go, who immediately teleported away from Aviana. Or rather tried to, as his first attempt resulted in him just teleporting from Aviana's left to her right. The 2nd attempt that followed was successful however and Aviana lost sight of the goblin.</p><p> </p><p>She continued her efforts to make peace with the satyrs but was having a tough time as she made one social faux pas (in the satyr's eyes that is) after another. When Aviana saw the rainbow-colored glow and heard the bleats coming from the forest's edge, she immediately knew what was to come and instantly regretted ever letting go of Plex's neck. The Lantern Goat stormed onto the clearing with Plex on it's back holding onto its horns for dear life. Now that was the kind of diplomacy the satyrs could get behind, and soon the music, dancing, and drinking started again, with Aviana, Plex, and the Lantern Goat as guests of honour. </p><p>All were having a good time until Aviana couldn't restrain herself any longer. The large boulder at the edge of the clearing was the first thing she noticed when she arrived here and she instantly knew that not lifting it would be something she'd regret for the rest of her life. The boulder's bizarre shape just made it even more intriguing, as it reminded her a lot of a giant goat's head. So she went over, grabbed it, and - didn't lift it. \"Strange\", she thought to herself and tried again, putting all of her strength into the lift. Much to her satisfaction, the boulder moved.</p><p>Much to her, and everyone else's, dissatisfaction however, it wasn't just the boulder that moved. The earth beneath the clearing shook and rose, higher and higher, until all could see the tops of the trees beneath them. Off in the distance, Aviana even saw a large patch of forest was completely grey. She didn't have much opportunity to ponder that however, as the head-like boulder she tried to lift turned out to be an actual head after all. Namely the head of a mythical Mountain Goat, who had been slumbering for eons. Who was very displeased with Aviana's attempts to tear its head off.</p><p>A fight for survival ensued as the Mountain Goat bucked and shook. The satyrs tried to hold on but one by one they fell off the Mountain Goat's back, disappearing into the treetops below with a scream. Plex wasn't having any issues himself as he had correctly figured that a goat wouldn't have any issues standing on another goat, and so he had once again climbed onto the Lantern Goat's back. Due to his growing experience with using unwilling Lantern Goats as mounts, he was finding it easier and easier to hold on. This even allowed him to save several of the satyrs from certain death, as he teleported them safely to the ground.</p><p>Aviana, unwilling - and unable - to let go of ~~her boulder~~ the Mountain Goat's head, looked for a way to resolve this situation and the first solution that came to her mind was, unsurprisingly, the broken Iron Flask. She grabbed it from her pockets and threw it at the Mountain Goat - and missed. Plex, witnessing Aviana's valiant attempt from the relative safety of the Lantern Goat's back, couldn't help but be impressed by Aviana's ability to miss a creature the size of a small mountain as he saw the small bottle plummet into the forest below - only to be followed by Aviana, who had no intentions of losing her precious Iron Flask.</p><p>Figuring it was a good time for him to leave as well, he teleported himself and the Lantern Goat down to the ground where Aviana was frantically searching for her Iron Flask. After a few minutes of searching - while fighting off the Mountain Goat's attempts to trample her - she eventually found her Iron Flask and noticed that the brass stopper was firmly closed. Before she had time to wonder what was now inside the flask, the Mountain Goat's hoof stomped down and Aviana barely managed to turn around and catch it. The weight of the colossal creature made her sink into the ground but she didn't budge. Getting stomped to death by a giant goat was not how she planned to die!</p><p>The Lantern Goat Plex was riding - or rather was trying to ride as he had no way of controlling it - was about to run past Aviana and the Goblin figured this was a good an opportunity to leave as they were gonna get. He just needed a moment to cast a spell - and for that his mount would have to be still for even a second. He shouted at Aviana and the conversation that followed went something like this: </p><p>Plex: \"Hold the goat!\"</p><p>Aviana: \"I AM! CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?\" </p><p>Lantern Goat: \"Bleeee!\"</p><p>Mountain Goat ( *very annoyed*): \"**BLEEEEEEE**\"</p><p>Plex: \"Nooo, the other goat!\"</p><p>Aviana ( *also very annoyed*): \"LISTEN HERE YOU LITTLE SHIT...\"</p><p>Lantern Goat: \"Bleeee???\"</p><p>And so Aviana grabbed the Lantern Goat's horn as it ran past, now holding up the Mountain Goat's weight with just one hand. Plex used this moment to open a teleportation gate in the ground beneath them and he, Aviana, and the Lanter Goat all fell through. A few hundred feet away, at the other end of the gate, Aviana got launched several hundred feet into the air as the force of the Mountain Goat's hoof pushed her through. Her fall back down was slowed by several tree branches so she was barely falling anymore when she landed on the ground. Plex, pleased with his efforts to save himself, Aviana and, most importantly, the Lantern Goat, realised that the Mountain Goat was still coming for them. And that he would very much like Fearghas to see it...</p><p>When Plex felt Aviana's hand tighten around his neck like a vice once more, he felt the weave around him snap as her action caused a wild magic surge. The world around Plex twisted and he felt like his stomach was pulled through his nose - the oh so familiar feeling of unwilling planar teleportation.</p>"

She is not happy about this, and when they meet up with us in the tunnel, she tries to strangle Plex, and both disappear to the Feywild. Again. We set up camp in the tunnel with the use of magic and grilled sausages.</p><p>We return to Ukgluz where many soldiers have been wounded in capturing the Leshen. Fearghas obtains an audience with King Dimzad, who is surprised to see him return alive, but more friendly than last time, and very forthcoming with (unwanted) advice on how to handle his slaves (that's us). There are some casual mentions of how to bind demons (shudder), and the \"demon engines\" the Duergar are using. This definitely is just an edgy name of no actual significance. Has to be. Right?</p><p>Fearghas requests a day of preparation before going to war with Matron Vandree. Dimzad agrees, and gifts to Fearghas a null-steel chain to better control his slaves. Fearghas invites us to his beautiful 7th-level mansion, and we have tea and investigate the null-steel chain. Emilio is particularly bothered by it. For Fearghas and I, it uncomfortably inhibits magic... and the chain's colour sends me into a panic as I suspect it's been made using the blood of angels.</p><p>Don't ask me how I know.</p><p>They ask me how I know.</p><p>Shalkoc assumes I have killed an angel.</p><p>Words fail me, surely this will have no consequences.</p><p>The party agrees to investigate the process of making the chains. We return to Ukgluz, ask around, learn that the chains are regular steel which are then treated in secret by priests, and no one is allowed in to see the process. Oh. No. Somewhere on the way, Shalkoc gets a ~~Discord ping~~ Message from Zariel checking in on his progress. Shalkoc replies that he has found an angel-slayer (HE MEANS ME) and Zariel orders him to present this person to her before the end of the week. Well this escalated quickly.</p><p>We can't figure out a way to spy on the priests yet, so we go to an apothecary for Shalkoc's needs of tasty herbs. We ask the apothecary if she has seen any unusual creatures, as Emilio insists the voidborn will return.</p><p>The Duergar just love to tell people how to handle their slaves. The apothecary scams us with foul-smelling \"mould\" (I'm convinced she chopped that off a rotting corpse somewhere) and mentions larvae larger than usual by a nearby lake. Fearghas freaks her out by saying he is an alchemist, and we walk to the lake.</p><p>Nature is twisted here, plants and larvae mutated, but Emilio doesn't sense the touch of the void. It reminds me too much of a certain demon and I grow increasingly anxious. Fearghas detects transmutation magic coming from inside the lake. We chug potions of water breathing, and jump in.</p><p>After a good half-hour of nerve-wracking swimming in darkness, and glimpsing tentacles among sharp pillars, we reach a brine pool and a fleshy wall pierced with long metal spikes. It looks like a huge, ancient creature being tortured. Reluctantly, I tell the party about the Sibriex lair I was in. I give them as much information as I can, including telepathic images of half-organic corridors and twisted creatures, but my courage fails me at the end.</p><p>We follow a current to a giant eye, also pierced with spikes. We can squeeze in... we don't talk very long before deciding to go in. The party is intrigued, but my conscience will not let me walk away. This thing is so close to a city full of people... slavers, yes, but people nonetheless.</p><p>Wait... the Duergar use \"demon engines\"? What if this big creature was *not* a giant tortured fish? What if the close proximity with Ukgluz is deliberate? I am filled with dread at the strong suspicion that we are... intruding into the lair of a Sibriex... that is *working with* the Duergar.</p>"

          "content": "<p>I meet the heroes at the gate. They are very kind to me, Aviana is a lot bigger than I expected! She nearly tramples some of the king's guards by mistake. Apparently this is temporary; Fearghas gave her a lot of non-soup potion?</p><p>The undead army threatening Lessia was scattered, so the king is preparing to throw a big party. There will probably not be any lemoncakes, but I still want to go.</p><p>Fearghas reports to the advisor to the king of Lessia (the king is nowhere to be seen) that the party delved into the mausoleum of Thamdarul to remove the undead general. The advisor nearly swallows his tongue at the news, and requests proof. He pulls a corpse from his bag of holding, as evidence. It's the corpse of Drakar Zul, the undead general and servant of the Lich.</p><p>The advisor fails to find words, asks Fearghas to put away the body, and goes to find the king. This is clearly far above his pay grade. A ring of dwarven guards surrounds the door the regent leaves through; they are very serious about their job.</p><p>The advisor, Mordram, returns with the king, who remains behind an honour guard of 30 dwarves. He thanks Fearghas for getting rid of the undead general, and announces the feast will also be dedicated to the party.</p><p>We leave the king's hall, and a giand Aviana waves at us. As if she was not TOWERING above everyone present. She proceeds to apologise for the rudeness. She has been speaking with the captain of the guard, Torgrus. He appears very tired, for some reason…</p><p>Shalkoc is ravenous, and Aviana goes on about her glasses. Fearghas is pleased by the outcome, somehow. Aviana thought I was a child, due to my very small size. I am offended. She is simply too tall!</p><p>As Mordram said quite clearly that Fearghas smells (he indeed does), Linzi recommends walking to a clear lake outside the gates to take a bath. Shalkoc is unwilling, and would rather kidnap a glassblower. Nobody wants to let Aviana stomp to the lake alone.</p><p>We all go to the lake. Shalkoc jumps into the cold water, Aviana opens a bottle, and Fearghas begins to scream. Shalkoc then gets out of the water, in a sense, and walks on it to the shore. Aviana says this is how he swims. Fearghas admits he doesn't know how the big lizard is doing it.</p><p>It turns out, Aviana freed an invisible Haunt and we are all flailing trying to catch it. I use my wand to cast Detect Magic, it does not help at all. We eventually have to give up and accept it flied away. Fearghas has a lot of words with Aviana, none of them friendly.</p><p>Shalkoc picks up a skeletal finger and begins to wave it around. I can sense necromantic energy in it; he casts False Life on himself and is very pleased with it. Linzi is happily taking notes, claiming this book will sell like crazy. I can see it. I can feel Fearghas' nerve weakening.</p><p>We walk back to Lessia and Fearghas explains about the giant rock floating in the sky. This is their island, Promise. I struggle to comprehend all of this…</p><p>The feast begins, and the king makes a speech. At this moment, a telepathic connection opens in my mind, and my boss, the Drow matron Vandree, tells me to explain why the undead army was routed, what is going on in Lessia, and what I've heard. I report with as much information as I am able, fearing for my life, my heart sinking into my socks as I am betraying Fearghas' home even as he sits right beside me. I ask whether the Drow will attack now, and before I can get a reply, the connection ends. I blink and come back to my senses, feeling sick. The king is nattering on about the people of Lessia and their courage, his gratitude to Fearghas… I am considering excusing myself, but I do not dare.</p><p>Fearghas whispers to me that the king is corrupted by a dragon's eye! The captain of the guard comes to Fearghas and whispers that a dwarf is here to see him and it is urgent. Fearghas gets up to leave, and I leap on the excuse to go with him, to leave the throne room. We meet with Barrik, who reports to Fearghas about the situation with the Duergar.</p><p>Lessia's mines are very close to Ukgluz, the Duergar setting I've come from… For years there has been an agreement between Lessia and the Duergar that they do not mine closer to one another. Recently however, orders have come from the king of Lessia to dig the other way. He MUST have known he would find the Duergar. Two or three weeks of digging found the Duergar, and the incident happened. We suppose the dragon eye is what caused the king to grow aggressive and seek to expand his territory.</p><p>As we discuss this, we hear a hollow roar coming from just above us! (I squeaked out of character, everything is fine.) A command rings out in everyone's minds; \"Give back what was stolen!\" We rush out to see a massive skeletal dragon carrying an undead man with a staff.</p><p>Fearghas and Aviana Windwalk to the gates, and Shalkoc sprouts a pair of wings, grabs me despite my screaming, and leaps into the air. 300 feet up above Lessia, I feel his grip slipping a little, and start apologising to my mummy and daddy. Somehow, he does not drop me.</p><p>We immediately start fighting the two undead figures. The dragon has a sickening bilious aura, and the Skull Lord teleports them both, it bites me because I am small (the audacity!), inflicting acid damage. We struggle, Shalkoc punches, the dragon starts destroying Fearghas. He is bleeding and within an inch of his life! Heedless of the risks, I rip my wards from my wrists and channel a heightened spell. I cast heal at 9th level, leaving Fearghas with barely a small cut.</p><p>Aviana tackles and dragon and drags it underwater, but it still beams its necrotic breath at us, Aviana dodges most of it but it hits me with full force. Fearghas shoots the Skull Lord several times with a Scorching Ray. Aviana is teaching the dragon to swim, for some reason.</p><p>We defeat the Skull Lord, and the Black Deathdragon, by shooting Shalkoc and having him deflect the missiles onto the dragon. Aviana emerges grumbling about poke-eyyyy-mons, and chucks the corpse of the dragon onto the shore so that Fearghas can start chopping it up.</p><p>Aviana carries the corpse of the dragon into Lessia, which is swarming with guards looking for Drow. The king's honour guard is blocking the entrance to the throne room. As we approach, the king leaps out and accuses Fearghas of being in league with the Drow, and having stolen the eye of Dahak! Not just that, but also to have lead the undead army against Lessia!</p><p>We tried to reason with the king. We tried everything. He is having none of it, and our only option was to be stripped naked and cast into prison to face \"justice\"… or resist. Fearghas put an end to the pointless argument, told his king he was ashamed of how low he had sunk, and teleported us all out of the throne room. We arrive in Locus on Promise.</p>"

          "content": "<p>After being accused by the king of Lessia of controlling the undead army, Fearghas refuses to put up with any more of that nonsense, and teleports us all to their flying island, Promise. Wait… me too? What about Linzi? We can't leave her behind!</p><p>As we materialise, there is a sound of metal falling, and Plex appears, trying to carry three full sets of plate armour, and failing. He takes a tumble and has a grumble about carrying all this. (Thank you Domi for the pipes falling sound, peak immersion.) Aviana offers ME Linzi's job, but I decline saying we must go back for my Halfling friend. Plex claims he traded the dead body that was inside one of the suits of plate armour while he was in the Feywild. Fearghas and Aviana are trying very hard to get him to say what he got in exchange for the body.</p><p>Plex traded the body of a dead dwarven hero for the freedom of his goblin friends Antrx and Prantx. He said it just in time to stop Fearghas from having a seizure. I'm not sure if I could heal that, definitely not with my wards on. Shudder…</p><p>We argue about the morality of eating and selling people. Could I heal myself if I had a seizure? I feel like I might find out, after hearing Shalkoc's arguments about selling organs. We also discuss what to do with the undead dragon's corpse, which Aviana is still lugging around like it's nothing.</p><p>Aviana contacts Linzi with a spell gem of Sending (\"the rock from the Hell Lady\"), and tells her to return to Promise. Linzi replies that she is hiding in the mines of Lessia with Barrik. Fearghas contacts Barrik with his own Sending spell, asking what is going on and whether Barrik needs picking up. Barrik replies that the king has started forcefully arresting people, and he fled with other people towards Ukgluz.</p><p>Fearghas turns into a cloud and skedaddles off to the mines of Lessia to teleport Barrik and his party to Promise. I slump on a couch inside the cabin, trying to recover from the whirlwind I have been swept into, when Aviana yells to me about dwarven smut stories, and Plex is looking for a sharp rock. Shalkoc is going up to his hoard to stow the dead undead dragon there. The dragon whom we sharply reminded of its own demise. Shalkoc wants it, for some reason. Aviana is looking for tools to make a tiara… for… me? Out of jade and dragon… bits? One of Shalkoc's scales? And a brick? She seems to struggle immensely, I somehow feel like Fearghas is here with us, shaking his head.</p><p>Aviana fumbles her crafting, and asks Shalkoc for further scales. I have a feverish image in my head of a harpy attemping to pluck a dragonborn like a chicken. In my defense, it is one in the morning, I have survived a battle and been teleported to a floating island, and feel I am starting to lose my wits.</p><p>I make some tea, and try to convince Plex to partake in a relaxing brew, but he sneaks off to town rambling about paint and gambling. He ignores my pleas about going to bed, and gets stopped at the gates by a guard who is convinced that our goblin is drunk. Plex attempts to explain that he lives in the forest, and much like Shalkoc earlier on the topic of selling people, or parts thereof, he only mires himself deeper. The guard leads him to the barracks to sleep off the assumed ale. Plex sneaks off, and wakes the entire town as he raises an alarm.</p><p>I give up looking for him and curl up on the couch to get some rest. I've slept much worse places. In the last week even. At least the couch is indoors, it's warm, and I assume the likelihood of being woken by slavers, or abyssal horrors, or why not both, is about as low as it's been ever since Edgar's shady friend dropped me off on the coast of Erastrea.</p><p>While I sleep, Shalkoc drapes a blanket over me without waking me, because he is very sneaky. How nice! But then Aviana goes to the town, growing huge again as Plex's Microscopic Proportions spell wears off. Predictably, she scares everyone out of their minds as she stomps around, a giant in the middle of the night. She claims it was just a test to get people accustomed to giants, as there is a trade agreement with, well, giants. She runs into Plex, who is still looking for paint. At this point I assume he means to fill his little lungs with the fumes, just for the funny feeling.</p><p>Even in my troubled dreams, I miss Fearghas' common sense.</p><p>Speaking of Fearghas, he is struggling to find Barrik and his party, having been to the mines very seldom. He is taking a long time finding his way, and has to cast Wind Walk again. As he does that, a wild magic surge hits him, teleporting him to the elemental plane of water. He drops into a deep, dark ocean with no prior warning. Does a cloud feel wet? This one certainly does, and grumbles healthily about wild magic.</p><p>I suddenly get upsetting dreams of Fearghas sinking in bubbling darkness. There is no way I am waking well-rested from all of this. He chuggs a potion of Water Breathing, casts Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion to escape the water (and sounds of whales and… ghost leviathans?? Aerelia I know you are going to read this, are you a Subnautica nerd? Great game, I cannot for the life of me play it. Not enough brown pants. Anyways. <em>- Haven't played it myself but I've watched multiple lets plays. Let's just say I'd find playing the game myself very boring because I wouldn't dare venture past the shallows…</em>), and then teleports back to Locus, from where he flies back, in cloud form, to the mines of Lessia to \"find those fuckers\".</p><p>\"I will pitch you like a baseball.\" - Aviana, 1497</p><p>And she does in fact, chuck the goblin and jumps away, landing in a massive explosion due to her cursed Thunderfeet Footwraps… Realising that jumping was a poor decision, she walks back to the cabin. She still cannot enter it due to being massive. She tries to cover herself with a dozen tiny (for her) blankets. I could probably wrap myself up in just one of these blankets like one Halfling maki roll.</p><p>Fearghas finally finds Barrik's party, they wonder why he is drenched but he clears it up with Prestidigitation. Even this much magic is terrifying to dwarves of Lessia, but Fearghas promises it's going to be all right, that magic is not scary. (I press X.) He works hard at convincing them that TELEPORTING is not scary magic. It takes one full hour, but props to ya, Fearghas. They all appear in Locus at dawn, and make their way to the cabin by morning.</p><p>I am woken by a completely exhausted Fearghas and many dwarves; he offers a room for me, and shuffles off to his own room to sleep. We meet up around three in the afternoon and go down to the living room to discuss what the hell we do.</p><p>I confess to the party that I am a spy for the Drow. Fearghas is angry, but he believes me and understands that I had no choice. I try to explain exactly how strong the Lady Vandree is, but I am no scholar, and can only relate what I've seen. Aviana suggests making friends, or fighting! Are they taking this seriously? When the matron comes for me on Friday, our lives will be on the line.</p><p>Fearghas proceeds to <s>google my boss</s> cast Legend Lore on the Matron of House Vandree. The spell only brings isolated words; exile, revenge, ambition. He then directs the spell to the Eye of Dahak; it is as expected an artifact of immense power.</p><p>We decide to go down to Ukgluz, and try to prepare for a confrontation with the Drow matron. Fearghas gives me a spellgem of Nondetection to shield myself from the matron's scrying spells (I assume that is what she is using to find me), and he places in his breast pocket one spellgem of Revivify, and a diamond that can be used to cast Raise Dead, in case one of us dies. Sadly he does not have a black sapphire, so I remain unable to summon my Umbral Spirit.</p><p>Aviana is considering which spirit to be blessed by, Fearghas is muttering about spells and gems, Plex suggests casting Death Ward on me. We are trying to figure out how to find the matron. I give as much information on the Drow as I can; the matron doesn't usually participate in combat, her three consorts are also powerful spellcasters, and the fighters are the backstabbing kind, or the shooting from afar kind. They are not keen on taking risks, as they aren't versed in healing magic.</p><p>Shalkoc flies off to find an ally of the party's, a spidery Drow lady called Kali, with very unsettling eyes. Fearghas casts Comprehend Languages because Kali speaks Druidic. We learn that House Vandree was led by twins… so my boss, the one who does NOT have the scar on her left eye, has a twin sister. One of the sisters was pronounced dead some years ago, but rumour has it that she was still alive. That is probably my boss. Kali giggles and says \"You have no idea who you are dealing with, do you?\", and tells us that House Vandree specialises in assassinations, and that their contracts are very expensive.</p><p>Plex wants to use me as bait, to draw the Drow party out and beat them up. I do not think that's a good idea.</p><p>The longer the conversation with Kali goes, the more concerned I get… House Vandree has immense power, and even an exiled matron is more powerful than I can imagine. I suspect that trying to fight her will get us all killed, or worse. Kali suggests we go to the Abyss and hire a DEMON to help us. (IRL my heart went cold at that.) Aviana tries to give to Kali a pristine white dress of an angel, bought in Hell. Kali is not terribly keen, considering the lack of pockets. I'm just sitting here white as a sheet at the talk of demons and angels. Eventually the memories haunting me are too much, and I am violently sick.</p><p>Fearghas decides to Wind Walk to Ukgluz and try to find my boss. However, we first stop at Fearghas' parents' shop to pick up supplies for a potion of heroism. Sneakily. As we hover over the shop in cloud form, we see one of the king's honour guards exit and walk away. The shop is closed and dark, but Fearghas' parents are nowhere to be seen. The house bears no signs of struggle, like the couple simply left. In the shop, many of the alchemical tools, and most of the ingredients and potions are missing. Fearghas collects the few remaining ingredients.</p><p>We head to Ukgluz, take a break for Fearghas to brew us potions of heroism, as Shalkoc whips up some rice balls to snack on. Plex casts Death Ward on me. Feeling as prepared as we'll ever be, we float above Ukgluz. It looks a lot more impressive from above, despite extensive destruction from boulders falling from the ceiling. Now… our campaign against the exiled matron of House Vandree begins.</p>"

          "content": "<p>As we camp outside of Ukgluz and Shalkoc wraps up rice balls, Fearghas contacts his father with spellgems of Sending. As he opens his bag, the thing blurts out \"You're the loveliest hag in the coven.\" His father is alright, though imprisoned, and Fearghas tells him he is trying to find a solution. Family love.</p><p>Plex and Aviana argue, grapple with each other, and both disappear. Fearghas sighs heavily, \"we do not have time for that\". Indeed we do not, but Plex teleporting another person is a new thing. Fearghas asks about my wards, I do my best to give an explanation, but leave out exactly how crippled I am without them. It's not a matter of trust, really… call it an expression of hope. We exchange quick information about our respective abilities. I cast Augury to consult the omens on our looking for the Matron, the results come up mixed; weal and woe. Well that is ominous.</p><p>We float down to Ukgluz in cloud form. It's an industrial place, all rough black stone. Soot from furnaces thicken the air. The city teems with slaves supervised by Duergar. There are many statues… The city looks very different from above. The walls are heavily guarded by more Duergar with glaives. (something about chaos dwarves and a war hammer, but none of us is using such a heavy weapon, how very odd!)</p><p>We float to the hospital, where I am known and hope to find some help, then we make for the morgue to transform out of cloud form without being seen. Fearghas and me are sneaky, but Shalkoc stumbles. In cloud form. How he manages that is beyond me. A Duergar accidentally inhales a whisp of Shalkoc and coughs. I am a horrified little cloud. The Duergar definitely notices a strange cloud, and alerts others. Shalkoc does his very best cloud impression, it seems to convince them as they laugh and walk away.</p><p>The coast is now clear, so we /uncloud in the morgue. There are three bodies covered in shrouds, and not much else. Shalkoc wants to disguise himself as a doctor. I say we should probably leave before somebody finds us living people in the morgue, and that the dead won't tell us much. Shalkoc disagrees and uses his little finger (well, Dam'ghur's little finger, which is now Shalkoc's, so Shalkoc's Little Finger Formerly of Dam'ghur's) to cast Speak with Dead (and that's a surge). Fearghas establishes a telepathic bond between the three of us.</p><p>Shalkoc begins to question the three dead bodies.</p><p>S: How are you today?</p><p>Dead: Cold.</p><p>S: Huh must be very cold being dead then?</p><p>Dead: Yes.</p><p>Shalkoc is enlightened by this and concludes that it must not be very nice to be dead. Fearghas sighs even as Shalkoc continues with the question \"Why are you dead?\". They reply in turn \"work accident\", \"defending Ukgluz\", and \"throat slit by a knife-ear\".</p><p>Fearghas tries to get Shalkoc to ask better questions, especially from the assassination victim.</p><p>S: Where?</p><p>Dead: The shrine of Azgal.</p><p>S: How to get there?</p><p>Dead: Walk.</p><p>And that's his five questions from the assassination victim. Fearghas makes sure nobody is coming our way. I say I worked with Thorkam Burnbleeder and we could look for him. Shalkoc further enquires from the other dead about the way to the shrine, and gets somewhat usable directions.</p><p>Fearghas makes Shalkoc and himself invisible so they can follow me undetected as I look for Thorkam. A guard approaches me, limping down the hallway with his glaive. He asks me where I come from, I reply I returned in a hurry because I need to speak to the Matron. Something with the guard seems… off. He is hiding something. I try to pry, but do not want to behave suspiciously and let him be on his way.</p><p>Shalkoc tries to grab the Duergar, losing his invisibility in the process. (8 strength but he rolls a nat 20, you can't make this sh*t up). The guard screams. Fearghas screams too, in our heads: RUN! Shalkoc sprouts his wings and flies off.</p><p><em>The mental image of Shalkoc flying into a random room, and ending up face to face with a MAD old Duergar lady threatening him with a hairbrush yelling SAAAAAAATANA. No this is not personal experience, ha ha.</em></p><p>None of the above happens in game, our Dragonborn escapes and Fearghas pretends very hard to be a potted plant, unseen, unheard. The Duergar attempt to arrest me for \"collaborating with the knife-ears\". I think to Fearghas: NOW we run. He breaks invisibility, and casts Dimension Door to teleport us to the roof of the hospital. Shalkoc is hiding in the morgue. Fearghas calls him to fly up to the roof, he lands saying \"WHEW that was scary!\". Both of us proceed to tell him off, and we then turn back to cloud form and hover towards the altar (the shrine of Azgal).</p><p>Fearghas picks up some of the words the Duergar are speaking; something about a scepter being stolen. We hover as clouds and brainstorm. It is not going well. Fearghas does some cloud shenanigans, casts Comprehend Languages, and eavesdrops on the priests at the shrine. It turns out that Dimzad, the king of Ukgluz, is furious that the scepter has been stolen, and in the name of all Duergar, he has declared war on House Vandree. Dimzad has sworn to execute all of House Vandree, especially after an unsuccessful attempt at dialogue, and an emissary now missing a tongue.</p><p>We decide to seek an audience with Dimzad, which may be a terrible idea, but it's better than blindly scouring the Underdark looking for the Matron. My very important job is to keep Shalkoc from doing anything stupid as Fearghas walks up to the very surprised king's guards and claims (in Common) to have information about the stolen Scepter of Azgal. He asks to speak to the king.</p><p>Fearghas is allowed to come in, under heavy guard, arms over his head at all times. If he makes the smallest misstep, he will be killed on the spot. Can clouds sweat? This small cloud is sweating so much, it might be raining. The darker cloud that is Shalkoc next to me seems to be sniffing the air in hopes of food smells, but all we pick up is ash, soot, and sulfur. If a cloud could wrestle another cloud, I would. I just frantically think at him to stay next to me.</p><p>Dimzad is one massive Duergar, who is intrigued that Fearghas is not an emissary, and working against the king of Lessia. He demands to know how Fearghas knows that Matron Vandree stole an artifact. Fearghas is struggling to explain himself, being very careful with his words. He claims he heard rumours, and reveals that the \"Matron Vandree\" the Duergar are hunting is the exiled twin sister who is my boss. The king grumbles about surface dwellers not knowing honour; an oath must be kept no matter what.</p><p>Dimzad asks Fearghas what he has to offer. Fearghas replies \"a Halfling who was enslaved by the Drow\". I think \"haha, yeah\" at that, and Fearghas mentally lifts an eyebrow at me. The king wants to imprison me in the deepest dungeon, and is surprised when Fearghas refuses, and says I am under his protection. The king does not want to let me run free (supposedly I am too useful), but Fearghas, bless his heart, insists that I should be free. Dimzad wants to put me in chains, use me as bait, fire on the Matron (and me) when she comes, and if I live, enslave me to work in the hospital again. Fearghas says it's too obvious a trap and it won't work because of my magic, and Dimzad casually says he can put me in antimagic chains. I start to scream in panic, in Fearghas' head (and Shalkoc's).</p><p>The king asks what artifact was stolen from Lessia. Fearghas honestly replies \"it's the eye of a dragon\". The entire room GASPS (even the walls I am sure; they tend to have ears so why not a mouth too, really). Dimzad is <em>very</em> interested. He asks Fearghas <em>why</em> he wants the eye of Dahak. Fearghas says he wants to inspect it in the hope to cure a curse. Dimzad is way too interested in the eye (and in the Halfling, that is me, supposedly the head doctor at the hospital spoke highly of me). All of the Duergar are deeply confused as to the simple <em>notion</em> of letting a healer run free…</p><p>The king does not believe that Fearghas and his group could deal with the Matron. (I don't blame him honestly.) For us to prove our strength, he tasks us with removing (he says the word \"close\") a nearby hindrance… a portal to the void. If we can manage this, Dimzad will help us. (Shalkoc is trying to puzzle out how that \"help\" will fit into his dragon hoard.) Fearghas agrees to deal with the portal in exchange for the Duergar's help to deal with the Matron.</p><p>We discuss the void portal. Fearghas assumes it connects to the Far Realm, and reveals that Plex:</p><ul><li><p>\"acquired\" a Demilich</p></li><li><p>found a void portal and started to communicate with it</p></li><li><p>was requested to make a sacrifice to the portal, and chucked the Demilich into it</p></li><li><p>asked for a friend in return for giving up the Demilich</p></li><li><p>was promised a friend, but the party closed the portal</p></li></ul><p>I have no words.</p><p>Fearghas wants to go fish Aviana out of the Feywild so that we can go deal with the void portal. I suggest scouting and researching first, because picking up our harpy from the Feywild is going to take a lot of magic. The portal is VERY close by, just an hour's walk from Ukgluz. We float there as fart clouds to investigate. As we travel, Fearghas and Shalkoc fill me in on how they are BOTH contracted to devils of Hell.</p><p>Fearghas assures me that I do not have to help him, or Shalkoc, fulfil their contracts. But I saved Fearghas' life, and I may be a strong healer, but I am not strong enough to watch a man I've healed, who has helped me, dive into deadly danger. I also admit my other reason to stick with him; if we are fighting demons, I am IN.</p><p>We arrive to an encampment of Duergar that are keeping watch on the void portal. We has proof that King Dimzad sent us here; a hat he gave to Fearghas, similar to the hat the king is wearing, but much smaller. We /uncloud at the bottom of stairs, to the sound of very heavy boulders being rolled. Fearghas reluctantly puts the hat on. There are ballistas around the camp, pointing at the… stairs? As we approach, the Duergar turn around, look at us, and Fearghas casts Compregend Languages. The Duergar say in Deep Speech \"The unbelievers have come for us!\". In the distance, heavy steps approach…</p><p>We roll initiative. The camp is also full of large, rolling stone creatures (granite juggernauts). I spring into action first, and try to restrain the nearest one with Binding Shadows, but they resist my magic. The eyes on these things are burning, but also blacker than night, a darkness so deep it seems to shine. (I snap at Aerelia at this, of course.) My spell has failed, and I very bravely hide behind Shalkoc, who rushes to the thing and punches it very hard. Shalkoc tanks like a boss with Turtle style, but also punches the juggernaut some more, for good measure. The juggernaut charges Fearghas, but our dwarf is too tough for the monster, stopping its charge. (bonk)</p><p>One of the ballistas shoots at me, but I am too smol! As Fearghas is distracted by the stone construct strangely… nuzzling… him, an iron golem stomps up the stairs and comes to nuzzle Fearghas on his other side. He is deeply uncomfortable. I get shot by another ballista, successfully (and painfully) this time. A chain is attached to the bold and it drags me across the floor as I (bravely) yell \"eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelp\". The same happens to Fearghas, with considerably less squeaking.</p><p>The next ballista shoots an explosive bolt at us, Fearghas has sick dodges and I am just out of range (phew). Fearghas summons a spiritual weapon to hit one of the juggernauts; the wheels slip out from under it and it crashes to the floor. It would be very funny if the iron golem wasn't looking at me like I'm kindling in the middle of winter… I free myself from the ballista bolt and try to run, but it has higher reach than I thought and slices me on the way out. I quickly heal myself but it only begins to knit my wounds.</p><p>Shalkoc bravely turtles to the golem and <s>spits</s> breathes on it. It does not work out great. One of the Duergar went invisible at some point so eeeeh… we don't know where he is. Shalkoc gets a major surge that makes all our potions useless. The golem punches him hard, then turns around and slices me with his sword (natural 20 aaaaaaa). It hurts a lot, and I am badly injured. Shalkoc punches half-heartedly, making very little progress. Fearghas gets harpooned again. The Duergar are running around repairing the ballistas. One of the Duergar tries to run, falls down, and breaks his neck. Less work for us…?</p><p>The bag of scolding savagely roasts Fearghas. He slaps a Curse of Biting Cold on the iron golem; Fearghas makes sure to shout to Shalkoc about the effects of that curse. He then shoots all of five scorching rays at the closest juggernaut (pew pew). He teleports himself out of the ballista bind like a boss, and bravely takes cover behind a pillar.</p><p>I'm hurting, bleeding, and afraid… I intended for a healing spell on myself, but for a moment the shadows guide my hand, and I direct them to the golem and the closest juggernauts for a Shadow Monsters spell. It works! I take cover behind the golem, cast a healing word, and then watch in awe as Shalkoc punches the hell out of the golem… with his fire gauntles… which would normally heal it. I crouch (bravely of course) behind the golem, and the next ballista shot misses me.</p><p>Fearghas magically and bravely shoots at everything. Go Fearghas! The juggernaut I hit with Shadow Monsters just rolls over the iron golem, absolutely flattening it. I frantically heal myself, popping sorcery points like candy. I want to take cover but I got hit and grappled by the braglista (the bragging ballista that insists I am a tiny fairy) so there is no way to wriggle free just now. Shalkoc goes to <s>spit</s> breathe COLD on the juggernaut and the very flattened iron golem. He also punches really hard again. What a lizard!</p><p>Meanwhile I am still getting repeatedly shot like I'm a plump little duck. Through multiple severe piercing wounds, I grit my teeth and hold on to my concentration with all my might. Fearghas tells me to get closer, that they shoot at the farthest target. Fearghas shoots at things once more, and tries to be the target for the bolts. I'm bleeding heavily; in barely controlled panic, I stumble to Shalkoc, free myself from the grappling bolt, and remove my wards to heal myself. It drains me, but the pain begins to fade.</p><p>Shalkoc rushes in, but as a deep stab wound opens on his body, a Duergar with a glaive appears next to him, invisibility spell shattered. My wards are on the floor and my body feels slow… I need to get to Shalkoc! The golem spews poison at Shalkoc, who appears completely unaffected (all the same, I squeak a little bit). Fearghas begins to rapid fire at the ballistas once more, getting frustrated at how poorly they burn (despite being made of wood). <em>Aerelia is a little sheepy because he gave them lots of HP.</em></p><p>Shalkoc is barely standing in the middle of enemies. I take out my onyx dog figurine and throw it to the floor, yelling the command word AMBULANCE! Dwen the Rock appears, I hop on his back and we run towards Shalkoc. My spellwards all but forgotten, I reach out to apply a <em>juicy</em> Healing Word on him (7th level). It takes a heavy toll, but Dwen steadies me.</p><p>The Duergar hits Shalkoc, and he is enlightened by this. \"Nah,\" our Dragonborn says with a dominating smile, \"let me show you how it's done.\" He can now crack a whip as well as Jill. Who's Jill? Don't worry about it. He takes an attack like a champ to punch back; the Duergar does not get back up. Fearghas is hanging out at the back, protected by a Shield pierced by dozens of ballista bolts. He tries again to cast Fire Bolt, fails again as his armour hampers him. He is fiercely grumbling.</p><p>I move in, still riding Dwen, and fire (haha) a Cone of Cold from my staff, and heal myself… almost to full… because my max HP has been lowered so much. Shalkoc continues punching, invigorated by my healing. Fearghas grits his teeth as he dashes and loads up a Ray of Frost that finally goes through, and deals a number on the golem, but it still stands. He commands his spectral axe to slash at the golem, getting it square in the chest. A black sapphire tumbles out! I limp to pick it up.</p><p>We made it… Shalkoc and me are injured and I'm shaking from the channeling fatigue, but Fearghas is mostly grumbling with GREAT conviction due to his armour's arcane failure rate.</p>"

          "name": "72 - A rainbow goat and other abominations",
          "section": "journal-pages",
          "content": "<p>Just as the fight ends, Plex and Aviana appear in a flash of light. Plex is riding a screaming goat surrounded by rainbow light. We start trying to figure out what is happening, when a man walks up to us, telling us to be quiet. His hair is white and his eyes are purple, very unusual colours for a human… He gives the name Emilio and tells us to shut up the goat one way of another. Fearghas is trying to make ANY sense of the situation, with very little success. Shalkoc slaps the goat, Plex ties a piece of yarn around the goat's neck and casts a spell, which stops the goat dead in its tracks, hanging from the now-immovable yarn. Plex flies off the goat's back, pulls a backflip in mid-air, and makes a perfect landing in front of the goat. He is standing halfway into the tent, through the tent really. A surge made him able to pass through walls.</p><p>I very tiredly ride Dwen in search of my spellwards, which I let fall during the battle. Emilio says the portal is extremely dangerous and needs to be closed right now before anything (more) steps out of it. We try to discuss the goat, and what to do with it, which is very difficult to do over the goat's screaming. Aviana argues that the goat is a political agent in treating with the Feywild, and that it MUST survive. Fearghas and Emilio ask that we please leave the goat behind. Plex is feeding scraps of tent canvas to the rainbow goat, which is trying to strangle itself on the immovable yarn. There is talk of another goat inside the iron flask.</p><p>We decide to rest for a moment before taking care of the portal of impending doom. Fearghas explains to Aviana and Plex what happened while they were in the Feywild. Shalkoc cooks a re-hydrate streak for himself, a burger for Fearghas, an eyeball-looking cake (??) for Aviana, and a recovery dumpling for me. Our harpy lady tries to give Emilio a cute nickname. He is not keen.</p><p>Fearghas asks for clarification about what happened in the Feywild. Aviana \"explains\":</p><ul><li><p>Plex made friends with goat people</p></li><li><p>People in the Feywild get extremely drunk</p></li><li><p>Aviana lifted a big rock, there was a goat underneath</p></li><li><p>The rock goat was scary, it stepped on Aviana, Plex used a gate to launch Aviana into the air</p></li><li><p>The Fey people gave Plex and Aviana the rainbow goat as a sign of thanks</p></li><li><p>The rock goat is still in the Feywild, and is very angry and Aviana and Plex</p></li><li><p>Plex teleported into the forest and found a lantern goat (our rainbow screaming goat)</p></li><li><p>Plex claims the rainbow goat is a party-saver and his friend</p></li></ul><p>Shalkoc wants to cook the goat, predictably.</p><p>Emilio is extremely overwhelmed by all this noise we're making. I try to soothe him, offering a cup of tea, or a chance to pet Dwen. Then Aviana tries to put the rainbow goat in chains. Plex and Aviana try to convince Fearghas to teleport the goat to Promise. He refuses, also predictably. Aviana begins to apply nail polish.</p><p>The goat stays behind.</p><p>Then Emilio says time is up, and we need to go. We go towards the portal, chugging various potions on the way. The air grows thick with purple mist as we approach. Translucent chains connect to the portal, on either side of a chasm filled with purple smoke. A scream sounds in all our minds; the others recognise the Void Dragon. Misshapen creatures pour out of the portal, along with a wave of void energy. Acid washes over us, Fearghas and I brace for it just in time, but the others get hit full force. Thankfully (?) I have experience taking acid to the face (maybe Fearghas too?). Plex looks at one of the monsters; it trips over its own claws and dies. One down! That was easy.</p><p>I step forward, riding my dog into battle. Brandishing my staff, I throw a fireball at the creatures, frying two on the spot (Chokers). Looking at the anchor for one of the chains, I see it is covered in runes. It is sturdy, but if it is hit JUST right, it will shatter. Emilio investigates the chains, after muttering that the runes are in Deep Speech. The chains are tangible enough to be held… therefore probably pulled… therefore probably yanked out of the portal. Emilio just… points, and blasts the insect-like creature (Wardu) three times, with incredible force (haha).</p><p>The big spiky creature (Otyugh) speaks to us in our minds… it projects images of an enormous purplish dragon covered in eyes. Plex then teleports himself to the portal with an Arcane Gate to get a good look. He does not get a good look. He still peers into the portal, and he does not understand what he sees. He's left feeling confused, afraid, and incredibly small and insignificant. Our goblin decides to step back and hide. We can clearly see his efforts.</p><p>Shalkoc accidentally steps through Plex' Arcane Gate, looks at the portal up close, and turns to the side real fast-like. He boosts himself with a scale, then <s>spits</s> breathes on the Otyugh. Aviana chugs a potion and becomes massive again. Possibly because her eyes are so big now, she can see the anchor a lot better, and concludes that they can be <em>disabled</em> instead of destroyed. She yells at Plex to turn off the magic thing. Fearghas steps through the Arcane Gate. He gets a <em>really</em> good look at the portal, and theorises he can <strong>overload</strong> that, which could damage it, and possibly destroy it if he were to throw enough magic juice at it. He can't rule out an explosion, but he says we will call that \"plan Bee\". I don't see any bees around here…</p><p>Emilio argues that portals are unstable by nature, and slapping more magic into it probably isn't a good idea. Fearghas then further investigates the anchor, looking for a way to disable it. He puzzles out the Deep Speech, and disconnects one of the chains from the portal. The portal… calls… for help. Plex' portal does not answer (we checked). More little shites come through. I knew it wouldn't be that easy…</p><p>The portal unleashes another wave of acid. Emilio is hit hard, and Dwen whimpers and reverts to his figurine form. A lot more creatures step through the portal, and last of them, an ominous, staff-bearing abomination scuttles out. That's another fireball. It fries up all the little things, but the scuttling thing (Warped Seer) dodges it. I try and fail to disable the anchor. Emilio tries too, but he is short on the brain juice. He fires at the Wardu but only one beam hits.</p><p>The Otyugh crawls up to Aviana, clearly impressed by her muscles. Chomp! But Aviana dodges the bite. She slaps the Otyugh's tentacles away. The aberration sends images to her mind of… rule 34?! Which confuses Shalkoc, our sweet summer Dragonborn. We move on. The Warped Seer scuttles over to Shalkoc and whacks him <strong>very</strong> hard with his stick. Shalkoc is severely injured and knocked prone… then the Seer hits him again. He goes down and does not get up again. The Seer then walks away and melts into the ground.</p><p>The flying tick (Wardu) looks at Emilio crosswise, then stabs me. Twice. Emilio is deafened by the Wardu's stare. Plex teleports Shalkoc closer to me. He's still not moving, and a wave of acid is coming up… Contrary to Aviana's belief, he CANNOT \"take it\". Aviana rages and stampedes into the Wardu, which is knocked back and pretty much lands on Emilio. She proceeds to do it again. She then grabs one of the chains (it feels slimy) and yanks it out of the portal. Fearghas walks up to another anchor but he is pushed back, returns to it grumbling, and gets pushed back again. His grumbling intensifies. He smothers it with an extra large potion of healing, just before a new wave of acid rolls out. More enemies appear, including a translucent, purple, humanoid… <em>thing</em>.</p><p>Shalkoc, if we survive this, you BETTER bake me some honey cakes. I take off my wards and summon what little strength I have left. Nobody is prepared for the burst of healing I unleash on Shalkoc; he springs to his feet, back in top shape. Emilio fires his lasers at the Wardu and it pops like a disgusting blood balloon. He tries to disable the anchor and fails, but suffers no bad consequences. Things are slapping Aviana. Things are slapping Fearghas. The Seer scuttles through the portal to Emilio and me. Plex! Help us! Any bright ideas are welcome!</p><p>Plex <s>rescues</s> teleports me across the chasm, and makes the Seer smell like <s>feeeeesh</s> fish. He tries very hard to shove the Seer off the edge with telekinesis, sadly the scuttling bastard resists it. Plex tries to disable the anchor, but fails and is pushed back. He immediately runs back to stand right in front of the Seer. Shalkoc punches the Seer, but he uses his reaction to swap positions with another voidborn… THE BIG PURPLE FUCKER. Shalkoc is unimpressed and punches on, stunning the hulking aberration. He continues to punch! With conviction! So much conviction! But then he tries to yank the chain out, causing it to reverberate. The disturbed chain radiates necrotic energy, hurting us all.</p><p>Aviana walks past one of the Otyughs, it bites at her leg, but she is unflinching! She casually continues to walk, dragging the aberration with her, teeth still clamped on her leg. She strides toward the Seer, ignoring minions. She grabs a Wardu and holds it in front of the portal. The Wardu gives her a judgemental glare. She is unfazed. Fearghas tries once more to disable his anchor. This time it's a success! Three more Otyughs crawl out of the portal. Fearghas conjures up one massive hand, then teleports closer to me with a Misty Step.</p><p>The portal expels another acid wave, but Aviana blocks it alone, protecting us all. She stands right in front of the gate… and she can just make out the shape of the void dragon rushing towards us. I heal Plex, then myself, and I try to disable the anchor, but fail. I take psychic damage and get knocked back. Emilio blasts the Star Spawn Hulk (the purple fucker), and also attempts to disable the anchor, but no luck.</p><p>Aviana has a lot of \"friends\" over there. They're scared of her. I would be, too. Shalkoc punches the Wardu with a Leaden fist; somehow it does not die on the spot. Then he runs off to help Aviana, who very much needs it. Aviana disregards the portal, and rushes to help us instead. Things slap at her on the way, to little effect, until one of them does… radiant damage?! That hurts. She juiced up on a potion of speed, so she reaches us, still holding the Wardu. She reaches into her pack and… throws a bedsheet… \"full of Plex stuff\" (wooden chicken statues)… across the chasm. The statues come to life and all peck at the anchor with their tiny knife beaks. They destroy the anchor, and a bunch of scuttling Seers appear, along with four Hulks.</p><p>Aviana squishes the Wardu for good luck, but it drips disgusting fluids all over her painted nails. With a warning for Plex, she yanks the chain out of the portal… but a force pulls it back. Something beyond the portal is holding the other end of the chain… She says she needs both hands and chucks me the Wardu. As she pulls the chain harder, claws and a snout appear through the portal, hanging on to the chain and trying to drag it back. She is doing a tug-of-war with the void dragon. She asks Emilio for advice. He says we're too late, that the dragon is coming through either way.</p><p>Detaching the chain from the anchor might be our only hope… Aviana hits the anchor, destroying it. The chain fades, and Aviana stumbles then catches herself just in time, very short of crashing into me. (That might have killed me, too.) The portal closes! But the voidborn remain…</p><p>The Wardu Aviana squeezes looks at Plex… menacingly. He's worried about his chickens. Aviana asks Emilio to pick up Plex' chickens. Shalkoc gets <s>yoinked</s> teleported into the middle of the voidborn. One of the Seers fires an orb onto one of the Hulks… it is healed, and reverberates the damage to everyone around it… Fearghas commands his Bigby's Hand into the fray and make it grab Shalkoc with the intention to chuck him towards us. We are trying to get the hell out of here. I use my last sorcery point on a twinned Guiding Bolt, bursting one of the Wardus. Emilio is trying to pick up Plex' chickens while Fearghas is yelling at him to leave the chickens.</p><p>Emilio… teleports? across the chasm. With a tiny void portal. The party's trust for him plummets. Plex already laments the loss of his chickens. I argue that he can't have chickens if he is dead. He is unconvinced. Shalkoc kindly casts Cure Wounds on me. It's weak sauce but I appreciate the gesture. Shalkoc tries (and fails) to pop the last Wardu. He goes into Turtle Stance <em>just to be safe</em>. I appreciate this gesture even more because I no longer have the strength to scrape him off the floor. Aviana gives the Wardu a good squeeze, sadly still not enough to pop it. She then jumps over the chasm to go get the chicken statues… The shockwave from her Thunderfeet shatters seven of the chickens. Plex might be about to cry.</p><p>One of the Seers is catching up to us and blasts Plex with three Psychic Orbs. In reaction he activates his Abjurer's Bangle, absorbing most of the damage. Another Seer fires at Plex; he crumples to the ground. The next Seer shoots, this time at me. It hits hard, but I keep my footing. I need to help Plex! Fearghas makes an Arcane Gate to the other side of the chasm, and says we are leaving. Plex… I rush to his side and heal him, and hesitate before running through the gate. Plex, Shalkoc, and Emilio are still on the other side…</p><p>Out of nowhere, tentacles burst out of the chasm, grab one of the Hulks, and drag it down into the purple smoke. An unfortunate event… for him, not for us. Emilio attacks, then runs into the gate. Plex casts Thunder Step, teleporting him and Shalkoc across the chasm. Aviana opens the iron flask, releasing a horned humanoid (it's a Leshen, we all recognise it). Aviana speaks friendly words in Sylvan. The Leshen turns into a flock of crows and comes for us. It casts a Wall of Thorns, Fearghas promptly pops a Counterspell gem… it does not work out. Emilio casts Counterspell. To everyone's relief, it works. The Leshen casts Grasping Vine, which lashes out at Emilio. He is pulled towards the vine.</p><p>Emilio is hit by three Psychic Orbs, and goes down. The Leshen hits me, triggering Plex' Death Ward. Fearghas apologises to Shalkoc, as he is out of range of his teleporting spell. \"Meet us back in the mines of Lessia.\" Shalkoc and Aviana are fast enough to run and meet up with us. They will have to be. We appear in the tunnel overlooking Ukgluz. Fearghas hands me a healing potion, and feeds another one to the unconscious Emilio. Plex is still mute, but he tries his best to communicate.</p><p>We sit in the dark tunnel nursing our wounds, waiting for Aviana and Shalkoc… and hoping.</p>"

          "content": "<h1>A rainbow goat and other abominations</h1><p>Plex, Aviana, and a screaming rainbow goat appear. A man with white hair and purple eyes tells us to be quiet, that includes the goat. We try several things to shut up the goat, including a piece of immovable yarn, with very little success.</p><p>We take a short rest, eat some food, and discuss:</p><ul><li><p>the goat's political importance in the Feywild</p></li><li><p>the void portal of impending doom</p></li><li><p>another goat, angry, and in the Feywild</p></li><li><p>goat people (I'm sure this will not come up again)</p></li></ul><p>We leave the goat behind and go to the cavern where the portal is. The ground is split in two by a smoky purple chasm. The portal is held open by five chains, anchored on either side of the chasm. The void dragon screams in our minds (that's rude) and the portal spits acid at us (no manners!).</p><p>There are some void critters, Plex kills one just by existing. I start to grill the rest of them, with great efficiency! I don't like this... it's too easy. Aviana seems to agree, she drinks a potion and becomes very big again. We figure out various ways to close the portal, including one that seems very unwise (overloading the portal with a lot of magic).</p><p>More monsters appear, these ones are intelligent and one of them beats Shalkoc senseless. Emilio is shooting beams, Aviana is charging, and Fearghas is <s>grumbling</s> trying to disable the anchors. I heal Shalkoc with such force that he springs to his feet without a scratch on him. (My upstairs neighbour has kindly been made aware of this.) Plex makes one of the Seers smell like fish. Aviana blocks an acid wave from the portal, holding a Wardu for emotional support (the Wardu's, not her own).</p><p>The more anchors we disable, the more monsters appear. Aviana throws Plex' chickens at them, then she plays tug-of-war with the void dragon, and nearly yanks it out of the portal! Emilio is pessimistic about the outcome, I don't blame him. Turns out he has void powers too. The plot thickens. There are a lot of Seers now and they are killing us real fast-like. We manage to close the portal, but there are now way too many abominations for us to handle. Fearghas says we are leaving, he makes a gate to take us across the chasm so we can run back to the cavern we came from. Plex is struck down by the Seers. I scrape him off the floor.</p><p>We eventually all get across the chasm, but Aviana has the bright idea to <em>once more</em> open the iron flask. An Ancient Leshen springs out and proceeds to beat us the hell up. Fearghas uses a spellgem to teleport us out of here, but he can't catch Shalkoc and Aviana into the range, so we tell them to meet us in the tunnel overlooking Ukgluz. We teleport there, all severely injured and Emilio unconscious. Fearghas feeds him a healing potion, and gives me one so I can feed it to myself (not in this order).</p><p>Now we just hope our friends can find us again.</p>"

          "content": "<p></p><p>Run.</p><p>They had to run.</p><p>The battle was won, the mission complete. The party had closed the portal, and if they wanted to live to tell the tale, they had to flee. One look at the misshapen creatures crowding the space where that portal had snapped shut was enough for any of them; this battle was not one they could win. With a blood-chilling cackle, one of the scuttling Seers lifted its staff and shot an orb towards one of its allies. A spark of hope flickered in Naami's heart; if they had gone mad and were fighting one another, the party could escape. But instead of being wracked with pain, the hulking creature erupted into mad laughter, a twisted sound that set Naami's teeth on edge. The void energy rippled across its skin, then began to reverberate. Like rings in water, it echoed outward, and reached Shalkoc. The Dragonborn cried out, new wounds opening next to the ones that had closed just a moment ago.</p><p>Fearghas gritted his teeth and commanded his giant hand to push into the fray, trying to reach Shalkoc. With the last of her strength, Naami fired twin bolts to distract the enemy; one of the overgrown ticks burst, splattering dark blood on the stone.</p><p>\"Leave the chickens!\" Fearghas shouted across the chasm. \"We need to get out of here! Now!\"</p><p>Plex' face fell at the words. \"But my chickens!\" The goblin cried.</p><p>\"You can't have <em>any</em> chickens if you're dead,\" Naami said through gritted teeth.</p><p>Emilio chose this moment to teleport across the chasm, cradling one of the chickens in his bandaged hand. He did not do it like Plex or Fearghas did. Instead of opening a gate or using a spellgem, he tore a portal through reality and stepped across in a haze of dark purple energy. Just like the void portal, only a lot smaller. Naami spared only a moment to frown, but she sensed Fearghas doing the same. There was no time to dwell on it. Shalkoc dodged the hulks' blows and ran to his friends. With a brush of his talons, he cast a healing spell on the Halfling. How the tables had turned! She smiled in gratitude, and he only nodded before shifting into a defensive stance.</p><p>\"I'll get the chickens,\" Aviana said, her voice thundering from her gigantic height.</p><p>Plex could only grimace as the harpy bent her knees and took off in a leap, wings gleaming jet-black in the darkness. She soared across the chasm, untouched by the ominous smoke. Her landing spoiled the effect, as the curse on her footwraps was triggered on impact, unleashing a shockwave that shattered seven of the chickens. Plex' shoulders shook with a sob; before he could get a word out, three psychic orbs hit him, seemingly from nowhere. In a heartbeat he raised a shield, the bangle on his wrist glowing with its magic. The bracelet saved his life, but it was not enough. Another three orbs connected; crying out in pain, the goblin crumpled to the ground and lay motionless.</p><p>Naami reached out towards him, only to get hit in turn. Pain coursed through her body like lightning, her head about to split; sound and light blended into a blur. Gritting her teeth, she pushed back the pain, fighting for agonising seconds to recover her senses. She had to help Plex. She had to find the strength to get him back on his feet!</p><p>\"Naami, we're leaving!\" Fearghas shouted, opening an arcane gate to the other side of the chasm and plunging through. The wizard's giant hand dissolved into mist, its purpose never fulfilled.</p><p>Just then, the billowing purple smoke exploded, revealing writhing tentacles that wrapped around one of the hulks and dragged it howling into the chasm. A shiver raced down Naami's spine. Whatever was under that purple smoke, it was nothing she wanted to meet. She shook her head and focused. This was no time for speculation. She summoned her waning strength and lay her hand on Plex' small chest, closing the worst of his wounds. His eyes popped open and he scrambled to his feet with a word of thanks. Naami sensed magic coalescing around him and reaching out to Shalkoc; both teleported across the chasm in a flash of crackling energy. She followed them through Fearghas' gate.</p><p>Emilio fired more blasts into the fray, barely seeming to aim and somehow hitting twisted flesh, then backed into the gate, appearing on the other side. The dwarf snapped the gate shut, leaving the voidborn to stare at the party. The other monsters were catching up on this side, and Naami knew they could try to run, but they would not make it. With her dog reverted to a stone statuette, she could not outrun the hulks. Plex' wounds would never allow him to escape. Emilio might make it, but Fearghas would probably not. Curse short legs! The Halfling was starting to understand Aviana's fascination for the potions that grew her to that huge size.</p><p>\"I've got a distraction for them,\" the harpy said, reaching into her pack.</p><p>Naami's heart froze in horror when she pulled out the dented iron flask, tiny in her talons. What was in there now?</p><p>\"Aviana, no!\" she screamed, but it was too late. The cork popped off, making no sound in the chaos.</p><p>A dark cloud rushed out, resolving in a tall horned silhouette. Although it was humanoid, it could never be mistaken for a person; not only because it was as tall as Aviana was after drinking the potion, but because it was made of dry wood and mossy bark instead of flesh and blood. Its arms ended in claws, a single one of those longer than Naami's staff. The curving, bone-white wood was sharp as razors. Where a face should have been, the creature had an animal skull from which sprouted imposing antlers. In the empty eye sockets, a spark of dark magic glowed.</p><p>Ignoring Aviana's attempts at friendly words, the creature raised a wooden arm. Threads of magic snapped into place around it, a spell taking shape. Fearghas held out a spellgem to try to prevent it, but the magic in the stone proved too weak. Emilio stepped forward, his fingers crooked, his eyes burning with magic as he spoke the counterspell. The creature's spell unravelled, but it showed no sign of caring. It flicked a finger, this time too fast for anyone to react. The ground cracked open, vines bursting out and lashing at Emilio. With a yelp he was caught and dragged back towards the chasm, far enough to be within range of the Seers. One of them took that chance and shot three orbs towards the party's new companion. Struggling with the vine, he had no chance to defend himself. Emilio did not raise his arms, did not cry out. His body went limp, slumping out of the vine's grasp.</p><p>Naami screamed, which only drew the creature's attention. Reflexes born of a lifetime of danger made her throw herself to the side. Wooden claws sank into the ground where she had stood, gouging the stone. Stunned, she could not evade a second attack. The claws cut through her shoulder with the ease of a blade ripping cloth. Her vision went dark, the world fading into nothing but pain. As light was about to disappear, Naami sensed Plex' magic around her. His ward against death was still on her! The weave fell apart now, leaving her barely conscious but alive. The shock dropped her to her knees, causing the creature's third attack to cut no more than a strand of hair.</p><p>Clinging to consciousness, a waterfall crashing in her ears, Naami scarcely made out Fearghas' voice.</p><p>\"I'm sorry Shalkoc, I can't catch you in the spell's range. You and Aviana will have to run. Meet us back in the mines of Lessia.\"</p><p>A few steps away, the Dragonborn nodded gravely. The harpy leapt down the corridor they had come from, a blur of speed and feathers. Then Fearghas' teleportation magic formed around the rest of them, and the cavern spun into nothingness. There was one second of weightlessness, a heartbeat of dizzying disorientation, then there was ground beneath them again. Naami recognised the tunnel they had rested in, overlooking the smoke and noise of Ukgluz. The rock was cold and hard against her knees, but she found myself unable to stand. Her legs would not respond; her entire body shook. Emilio was next to Naami, lying on the ground with blood trickling from his closed eyes. The pained sound of his laboured breathing bounced between the tunnel walls. The grave urgency that had hung around him like a cloak was gone, and he looked much smaller, little more than a sickly boy. Naami could sense his life force flickering, a candle in the wind. If she could not stand, then she would crawl. She would not let him die. She would not let anyone die as long as she drew breath.</p><p>She reached out towards him, calling her magic. Her spellwards were cool on her wrists; if she took them off, could she save him? Naami's hands trembled as her thoughts tangled; at the back of her mind, she suspected that an attempt to channel would kill her, and no goblin magic would save her this time. But magic was not the only force that could save a life! She had herbs in her pack, and an ointment that could close wounds as fast as a spell. She could sew his worst wounds closed to stop the bleeding. She could...</p><p>\"Drink this, lass.\" Fearghas' voice pulled her mind from its fevered track. \"You're in a sorry state too. I'll get some life back in him.\"</p><p>He handed her a potion that glittered like liquid ruby dust. It took three attempts with her left hand to uncork the bottle; Naami's right arm was burning with pain, the muscles unresponsive. She sipped the potion, and the pain lost ground, sensation returning to her fingers. Fearghas crouched next to Emilio, dripping another healing potion into his mouth. In seconds, the young man opened his eyes, purple irises resting on Fearghas, then on Naami.</p><p>\"We're alive,\" he murmured.</p><p>\"Barely,\" Fearghas grumbled, standing up.</p><p>Naami got her first good look at Emilio's eyes then. They were narrowed as he winced from the pain, and blood coloured the whites, but that was not what made them so unsettling. As a healer, she had seen pain and agony; she had seen fear and broken courage. That was not what showed in Emilio's eyes. The haunting purple irises seemed hollow, as if to draw in light. His eyes did not belong in such a youthful face. These eyes... had seen entirely too much. As vague as this was, it was the only way she could describe the emptiness she sensed. Whatever he knew, it had taken a lot out of him. Maybe it had stolen something from him, forever.</p><p>Plex limped over to them, waving his hands.</p><p>\"Magic got your tongue?\" Fearghas said, a spark of amusement in his eyes even as his shoulders sagged under the weight of weariness.</p><p>The goblin nodded so empathically, Naami feared the sudden motion would aggravate his wounds.</p><p>\"No can do, for now,\" the dwarf said.</p><p>\"Where are Shalkoc and Aviana?\" Emilio asked, struggling to form the words.</p><p>\"Running. They'll meet us here, I hope.\" Fearghas grumbled.</p><p>\"They better meet us here,\" Naami said, her heart aching with worry.</p><p>Plex nodded as Emilio murmured assent. It was frustrating to the point of madness, but there was nothing Naami could do but sit and wait, hurting and shaking. There was nothing to do but wait and hope.</p>"

          "content": "<p>Aviana and Shalkoc escape arrest by the Duergar by… Shalkoc flying up, with Aviana inside the iron flask. They leave the Duergar to deal with the Leshen, and Shalkoc flies up to the tunnel where we had been huddling for about three hours. We've had a short rest, and Plex is no longer mute. Shalkoc releases Aviana from the flask; she is grimacing with a terrible headache, and is in a vile mood. After a few words from Plex, she again grabs his neck, and both of them disappear. Fearghas attempts to explain the process to Emilio, he does not seem very enlightened.</p><p>Shalkoc is very out of breath from flying all this way, so Fearghas casts Leomund's Tiny Hut as a ritual, conjures up Unseen Servants, and we set up camp in the tunnel. The bag of scolding grills Fearghas, we take a long rest. Shalkoc cooks up an impressive amount of bacon, egg, and sausage, helping everyone feel alive again.</p><p>We discuss our plans, the voidborn, and whether Shalkoc could conceivably feed all the void invaders to appease them (not likely). Motivated by Fearghas' enthusiam (and reluctance to burn a 6th level spell slot first thing in the… evening? We slept the day away), we walk down to Ukgluz. Many of the statues in Ukgluz are severely damaged, scratch marks like those left by giant claws. The hospital seems to be overflowing with wounded soldiers, most of them with broken bones like they've taken a big fall. Some look like they've been bitten by a swarm of mosquitoes. I ask the party if they know what kind of creature could do that. Fearghas says a spell could do that; Insect Plague.</p><p>We assume all these wounds occurred in the Duergars' attempt to capture the Leshen. :')</p><p>Fearghas asks for an audience with King Dimzad regarding the void portal. We are ushered in by excited guards who did not expect we would survive. We are all impressed by the strength of the neck on King Dimzad, supporting the massive hat on his head. He greets Fearghas, surprised and pleased to see him, congratulates him on the… use of his slaves (that's us). The Leshen apparently destroyed several of the Duergars' demon engines; they eventually caught it, but it's proving troublesome, \"like a demon but not quite\". Shudder…</p><p>Fearghas explains that the Leshen comes from the Feywild, but that he doesn't really know any more about it. Dimzad wants to get his hands on Aviana (alive or dead) to try to bind the Leshen. He does not seem to understand that Fearghas can't just sell him Aviana. Dimzad claims that the more emotional a demon gets, the easier it becomes to bind it. I'll keep that in mind… The king is pretty convinced that the Leshen is a demon and not a fey creature.</p><p>Fearghas reminds Dimzad that there was an agreement for assistance in fighting the Matron Vandree, but the king tries to backtrack and say that closing the portal only proved that Fearghas is \"worth serving him\". Fearghas guesses that Dimzad is just saving face in front of his court and not actually trying to short us. Phew… Dimzad and Fearghas proceed to have a very uncomfortable conversation over my head about training your slaves, and keeping me from escaping. The king suggests a chain of null-steel, and promises to gift one to Fearghas.</p><p>On the way out, Fearghas mutters that he hates Duergar. Shalkoc replies that we should deal with them once we are done with the Drow. I am shaking at the thought of anti-magic shackles. Emilio is brooding. One of the king's servants comes to us carrying a very heavy chain that looks like it's covered in soot, despite being clean. Fearghas receives advice to \"bind the Halfling with that\". He examines the chain with great interest. I am definitely uneasy. Fearghas? We are friends yes? We're at least allies?</p><p>Fearghas casts Detect Magic on the chain; it is non-magical. He knows that it inhibits magic, but does not understand exactly how, yet. Fearghas leads us into an alley out of sight, and casts Mordenkainen's Magnificient Mansion. It is an impressive dwarven mansion, with a cohort of servants that look like clockwork constructs resembling dwarves. Fearghas formally welcomes us in, and Shalkoc makes a beeline for the larder that is bursting with ingredients. Emilio and I are confused as to how anyone can casually cast a spell of such proportions. He's not wearing spellwards! Let alone taking them off!</p><p>One of the rooms is a \"hall of grudges\". A dwarven thing, Fearghas says. Don't worry about it. There are three categories in the hall, alphabetically ordered: A, G, and P. I wonder what is written in there… We start discussing magic and its various origins. Emilio says his magic was forced upon him, he is not comfortable with explaining. Fearghas says that wild magic surges did not always happen, that they appeared a long time ago, from the Feywild \"bleeding\" into the material plane. He also says that infusing spells into gems can bypass the wildness of magic.</p><p>Fearghas is still curious about the null-steel chains, and asks Emilio to bind his wrists with the chain. On the point of touching the chain, Emilio recoils and takes a few steps back. I offer assistance, but Emilio declines. Fearghas asks Shalkoc to bind him instead. It's a cold burn on his skin, and he grows tired and unfocused. He is not comfortable. Shalkoc winds the chain around his wrists, and does not seem to mind the cold touch.</p><p>I agree to have the chain put on me… for science. It's a little bit like my spellwards, just a million times more intense. Familiar, if uncomfortable. As I examine the chain I realise… the one dark spot on one of my bracelets is the exact same colour as the chain. I freeze, mind racing. Shalkoc and Fearghas kindly ask if I'm okay, but I start stammering that I need to know HOW these chains are made. I can't stop myself from shaking and praying that my suspicions aren't true. Concerned, Fearghas suggests that we look into it right now. I agree, trying very hard to keep my emotions together and mostly failing. We go back to Ukgluz in a hurry to figure this out.</p><p>We go to the market looking for a smithy. Looks like the Duergar eat a lot of fish from the many many lakes in the Underdark. A Duergar comes up to Fearghas wanting to buy Emilio. Fearghas politely declines. Emilio looks even more grumpy than usual, especially as the Duergar insists… Fearghas asks how the null-steel chains are made. The Duergar says they are regular steel chains, that are brought up to the priests in the temple, and the chains come out soot black and much stronger. I do not like where this is going…</p><p>Fearghas casts <s>Discord call</s> Rary's Telepathic Bond so we can communicate discreetely. I am questioned about my suspicions regarding the null-steel chains, and I reluctantly admit that I suspect the Duergar are using the blood of angels. I show my stained spellward to support my claim. Fearghas is intrigued, and Shalkoc assumes I have killed an angel. I can't find any words in response to that… Emilio wants to ask around about more voidborn, or another void portal. A frightening perspective. I wish our big and strong harpy was with us.</p><p>Shalkoc suddenly… claims that \"we are working on it\". Zariel just contacted him and asked how they are doing. He winks at me. I am so confused. He shares Zariel's messages with us, demanding to know Shalkoc's progress on their contract, and details. Shalkoc claims he met someone who kills angels. He means me. Now Zariel wants to meet this \"angel-slayer\" within a week. It's not a question, it's an order.</p><p>At the party's prompting, I confess that I killed an angel. I was trying to help, I did not mean to. Emilio tries to cheer me up, with little success. Fearghas says that we can't blame ourselves for circumstances outside of our control. If only their words could make the nightmares end… I clutch my staff to remind myself that even a stained soul can be forgiven. It will not make the nightmares end. Shalkoc just takes it in stride that I am an angel-slayer, and we can keep Zariel waiting before sending me to Hell to meet her.</p><p>We go browse herbs for Shalkoc who is looking for seasoning. Fearghas grimaces as we walk into a shop (something about \"a bunch of snake oil\"). The shopkeeper is doubtful about letting slaves in, but Fearghas insists. The lady shows us a very dubious brown mould… which I'm sure is some kind of body part… very much not fresh… She offers to let Fearghas sniff it. Shalkoc is enthusiastic and speaks up about wanting to smell it. Out loud. The shopkeeper is SHOOKETH at the lack of control Fearghas has over his slave… She then opens the glass right under Fearghas' nose. He downplays the absolute reek of the stuff with all the dwarven sturdiness he can muster.</p><p>I recognise glowworm root, that wriggles and glows in contact with air. It's edible and nutritious, if not pleasant. There is also a fungus called barrelstalk… drinkable, as they store a lot of water, but they taste like very stale, very mushroomy flavour. On Emilio's behalf, Fearghas asks the shopkeeper if she has seen any unusual creatures when she was out gathering plants. She claims some larva-like creatures near a nearby lake have been unusually large. Fearghas enquires about the deeprot (the brown mould) and its uses. He buys a portion for 15 gold, and she saws off a piece of the growth, scrapes up the mould, and hands it to our alchemist. She claims it's great for freeing up clogged sinuses. I am doubtful.</p><p>Fearghas mentions he is an alchemist and the shopkeeper begins to stammer. She was scamming us was she not… She says she has to close down the shop now. The apothecary very nervously closes down her shop. She did mention that the miners use the deeprot, and also the priests. We walk to the lake some miles away. It's relatively peaceful, for the Underdark. The water is very still, and on the shores grow bioluminescent lichen. As we walk up to the nearby shore, we smell something disgusting. The plants on the shore look mutated, leaves growing out of other leaves like cancerous growth.</p><p>We find the larvae mentioned by the apothecary. They are massive, and also mutated, growing into one another in a chaotic and twisted manner. Fearghas says there is something \"fucked up\" here for sure. Emilio doesn't sense anything void-y. Shalkoc argues that the larvae must be full of protein. Fearghas absolutely vetoes the idea and investigates, finding a faint trace of transmutation magic in the mutated things. It seems to be coming from under the lake. Fearghas hands out potions of water breathing. I can't swim, so Fearghas says \"take my hand\". We all drink our potions and jump into pitch-black water.</p><p>We lose all sense of up or down in the absolute darkness. Emilio seems to be able to see… just fine? For the rest of us, the colours are gone, so he updates us on the fish's weird colours. The fish are looking at us weirdly, some with all three of their eyes. We swim deeper down, pressure building on my ears the only indication that we are farther from the surface. In the distance, a bright light flickers. Fearghas is guiding us towards the source of the transmutation magic he sensed. We can't really gauge direction or distance from the light source. Is it moving? We can't tell…</p><p>We approach carefully, all too aware of the tactics of anglerfish. Emilio spots first the tips of multiple spikes, unevenly spaced, rising from below us. He says they look like quills, like they are part of something bigger. As we come closer, it's a full forest of them, about half a metre in diameter, growing to a very sharp point. D-do they look like needle-sharp teeth…? The light source we saw from afar is actually a tiny fish swimming in a circle, with a luminous growth on its head.</p><p>We give the glowing fish a wide berth, and swim on downwards. Emilio glimpses something moving in between the big spikes. I finally remember to use magic to enhance my vision. Out of the corner of my eye, I spot the end of a tentacle between the spikes, retreating out of sight. I stammer \"k-k-krakeeen!!\" in the telepathic bond, which seems to amuse Fearghas and Shalkoc. We spot a flat white surface below us; as we grow deeper, we see it's a brine pool. We swim closer to it but stop short of it, oh goddess I hope we survive this.</p><p>We spot more spikes, these looking more metallic and a bit rusty. These spikes are not attached to, but sticking through a surface… around the spikes is scar tissue… very old scar tissue, wounds that have healed and re-opened over and over again for years. I imagine this wall of scars in front of us is an ancient creature, and a very large creature that has been suffering for longer than I can imagine. We pick a direction at random and follow the wall, hoping to find a head or a tail. Fearghas swims down into the brine pool, promising to go back up immediately.</p><p>He swims back up a good 30 feet away from where he dove. There is a current in there. We follow the direction of the current with the idea that one person dives into the brine pool now and again, tied to a rope so we don't lose them. We figure out the rough shape of an immense flattened blobfish. At the edge of the brine pool, the skin of the creature becomes flat and glassy, a giant eye mostly immerged in the brine pool. The eye is so huge we cannot see it all. Multiple spikes are piercing the eye… we can see into it, the needles pierce all the way through. The outside wounds have closed, but on the inside, the wounds are a lot worse. We could squeeze along that spike into the body of that thing… there seems to be light inside.</p><p>I tell the party about what I think is torturing the creature. Sibriex. I show them my memories of an angel endlessly tortured. Clinging to sanity, I tell them that this is my problem, that I cannot let this demon live. We decide to go into the creature and attempt to end its suffering. As we are about to go in, the giant fish begins to shake as if in pain… This creature is alive, and it's being tortured. As it moves, the spikes tears bigger wounds in the tissue surrounding them. Shalkoc is leading, and squeezes through the opening with a squelching sound, and he disappears from sight.</p><p>A chilling thought occurs to me then. What if it was not a creature being tortured? Not a fish pierced by spikes but something that was never an animal in the first place. What if this was a space shaped by a demon? A Sibriex' lair.</p>"

          "content": "<p>Shalkoc flies away from the Duergar with Aviana in the iron flask. She is not happy about this, and when they meet up with us in the tunnel, she tries to strangle Plex, and both disappear to the Feywild. Again. We set up camp in the tunnel with the use of magic and grilled sausages.</p><p>We return to Ukgluz where many soldiers have been wounded in capturing the Leshen. Fearghas obtains an audience with King Dimzad, who is surprised to see him return alive, but more friendly than last time, and very forthcoming with (unwanted) advice on how to handle his slaves (that's us). There are some casual mentions of how to bind demons (shudder), and the \"demon engines\" the Duergar are using. This definitely is just an edgy name of no actual significance. Has to be. Right?</p><p>Fearghas requests a day of preparation before going to war with Matron Vandree. Dimzad agrees, and gifts to Fearghas a null-steel chain to better control his slaves. Fearghas invites us to his beautiful 7th-level mansion, and we have tea and investigate the null-steel chain. Emilio is particularly bothered by it. For Fearghas and I, it uncomfortably inhibits magic... and the chain's colour sends me into a panic as I suspect it's been made using the blood of angels.</p><p>Don't ask me how I know.</p><p>They ask me how I know.</p><p>Shalkoc assumes I have killed an angel.</p><p>Words fail me, surely this will have no consequences.</p><p>The party agrees to investigate the process of making the chains. We return to Ukgluz, ask around, learn that the chains are regular steel which are then treated in secret by priests, and no one is allowed in to see the process. Oh. No. Somewhere on the way, Shalkoc gets a ~~Discord ping~~ Message from Zariel checking in on his progress. Shalkoc replies that he has found an angel-slayer (HE MEANS ME) and Zariel orders him to present this person to her before the end of the week. Well this escalated quickly.</p><p>We can't figure out a way to spy on the priests yet, so we go to an apothecary for Shalkoc's needs of tasty herbs. We ask the apothecary if she has seen any unusual creatures, as Emilio insists the voidborn will return.</p><p>The Duergar just love to tell people how to handle their slaves. The apothecary scams us with foul-smelling \"mould\" (I'm convinced she chopped that off a rotting corpse somewhere) and mentions larvae larger than usual by a nearby lake. Fearghas freaks her out by saying he is an alchemist, and we walk to the lake.</p><p>Nature is twisted here, plants and larvae mutated, but Emilio doesn't sense the touch of the void. It reminds me too much of a certain demon and I grow increasingly anxious. Fearghas detects transmutation magic coming from inside the lake. We chug potions of water breathing, and jump in.</p><p>After a good half-hour of nerve-wracking swimming in darkness, and glimpsing tentacles among sharp pillars, we reach a brine pool and a fleshy wall pierced with long metal spikes. It looks like a huge, ancient creature being tortured. Reluctantly, I tell the party about the Sibriex lair I was in. I give them as much information as I can, including telepathic images of half-organic corridors and twisted creatures, but my courage fails me at the end.</p><p>We follow a current to a giant eye, also pierced with spikes. We can squeeze in... we don't talk very long before deciding to go in. The party is intrigued, but my conscience will not let me walk away. This thing is so close to a city full of people... slavers, yes, but people nonetheless.</p><p>Wait... the Duergar use \"demon engines\"? What if this big creature was *not* a giant tortured fish? What if the close proximity with Ukgluz is deliberate? I am filled with dread at the strong suspicion that we are... intruding into the lair of a Sibriex... that is *working with* the Duergar.</p>"

          "content": "<p>As Shalkoc disappears inside the Sibriex lair (?), Emilio turns around and sees Aviana appear, with one hand around Plex' neck and the other hand holding… a screaming goat, making a lot of bubbles. Shalkoc sticks his head through the opening at the base of the spike, and signals that the inside is dry. We follow him in. Aviana asks about the goat, arguing that it was going to be a sacrifice. Fearghas rolls his eyes, and promptly roasts the goat with a Fire Bolt; \"we don't have time for <em>another</em> goat.\" He pushes me through the opening; I collide into Shalkoc who smelled the roasted goat and wonders what is cooking.</p><p>We eventually all slip through the opening, in the residual smell of soggy goat curry. The tunnel we are in is damp, uncomfortably warm, walls glistening and pulsating. It smells like a constitution save… we hold our noses in disgust, but Plex and Emilio don't look so good. We hear an androgynous, gentle and caring voice in our minds telling us: <em>I felt your arrival, like soft whispers in the æther. Fear not the crossing; you are safe now within this hallowed realm.</em> Emilio is very angry at this. Something about enough voices in his head…? I tell the party to not trust it, that the demon is trying to get us to let our guard down. Fearghas agrees, and hands me a vial of silvery powder… He does not say what it is, only urges me to consume it as he hands a similar one to Emilio.</p><p>Aviana explains that Plex acquired a goat hat, and the curry goat that Fearghas murdered. She also says that she and Plex could not save the kittens in the Feywild from the red caps, and that we have to return there to save the kittens. Fearghas hands the null-steel chain to Aviana, who goes on a tirade about king and why we should all settle for bondage instead. Plex pulls out his thinking cap, a Headband of Intellect in the shape of a goat. Aviana grabs the headband with the plan to reforge it into thinking glasses.</p><p>Fearghas asks me whether the Sibriex has mental powers. I say yes, though I can't be entirely certain. He uses a spellgem of Mind Blank on Aviana. Plex no longer detects her with Detect Thoughts. She is no longer a thinking creature as far as his spell is concerned… He then recasts Rary's Telepathic Bond to include Aviana and Plex into the connection. Plex casts Fey Step, ignoring Fearghas' warning against teleporting in here… He takes a step up… and thinks to us that there are enemies next to him. We can't see or hear him. I summon my Umbral Spirit, Fade, and tell her to find the goblin. I also heal Emilio to cure the poisoning incurred when he stepped into the lair.</p><p>Aviana steps up to me and says proudly \"Look! I can do magic too!\" She says some gibberish words, then casts Death Ward on me! Fearghas is incredibly proud. Plex is being attacked by humanoid creatures that… look like they used to be people. Some bits swapped, a messed up jaw, and psionic shullbit. Fearghas considers breaking through a wall to get to Plex, then evaluates the thickness of the wall, and reconsiders. He sees something up ahead, and is in turn seen by it too. It's a swarm of maggots, and something invisible. I miss my mum and dad…</p><p>Shalkoc runs past Fearghas into the left branch of the tunnel. He sneezes on the swarm of maggots, like only a Dragonborn can, burning them all like popcorn. Delicious… Something lashes back at him, and he is stunned. Fade runs down the tunnel, attracting unwanted attention. She does not find Plex, and blends into the shadows, turning invisible. Plex casts Ashardalon's Stride to unleash fire on the maggots, but a wild magic surge turns him tiny. He picks up popped, not burnt, maggots.</p><p>Aviana congratulates Emilio on being the most sensible, least aggressive member of this party. Plex glimpses an honest-to-gods ABOMINATION, bloated with a second head that is nothing but a gaping maw. I very frighteningly sidle close but not too close to a big lump of wall-flesh… Bits of it seems to be chewing… I don't want to know on what… I inhale the silvery powder Fearghas gave me, trying all the while to look everywhere at once. Aviana chugs a potion of growth and becomes big again.</p><p>Fade is hit by a psychic ray from a Walleye, but the charm has no effect. Plex is getting attacked by something bitey but he's so small he <strong>dodges</strong>… once. On the second bite, he is <strong>swallowed</strong> by the Bloater. Plex uses his gift of the Gem Dragon to push it back, inflicting minor damage. He is still inside the thing, swimming in stomach acid. Fade runs back to where I was to report, as I don't share her senses… but I do feel what Plex is feeling and it's not fun.</p><p>Plex blasts the Bloater from the inside with his magic, hard enough to be spit out. Emilio buffs himself somewhat uselessly, but who knows what the future may bring? He joins Shalkoc by a pile of dead maggots. The Bloater dashes towards Aviana, this waddling thing as big as Aviana. It's aptly named… it's so full of fluid, the skin is tight and it makes sloshing sounds. Disgusted, I focus my magic at it and fire a Guiding Bolt! It hits real hard, and I leave Aviana to deal with it as I join Shalkoc, Emilio, and Fearghas. The latter is grumbling at something and flailing with his axe. A wild magic surge makes him explode-y.</p><p>Aviana is highly disgusted by the Bloater and dreads getting vomit on her new dress. She enters rage and slashes at the Bloater with her talons, tearing it open. Fluids spill all over her. She is deeply disgusted. I don't blame her. Plex is considering the benefits of being eaten again, even though he is already in a rough shape after the first time he was snacked on. He is bitten by the second Bloater, swallowed again, and uses a MYTHIC FEATURE to convince himSELF that he is not blinded in there. I'm screaming in the telepathic bond because I feel his wounds, and he will die if he is exposed to the stomach acid again. He beholds the wonders of the inside of the Bloater's stomach with eyes open. If we did not need the telepathic bond for a petty thing like SURVIVAL, I would nope out.</p><p>Fearghas enquires on the state of the Bloater. Aviana says it's probably almost dead; I squeak that it is still very much moving despite leaking fluids everywhere. Fearghas sends a barrage of Magic Missiles towards it. This is how he figures out that there are two of them; because Plex is broadcasting the inside of a Bloater through the telepathic link, and no impacts happen. Shalkoc is punching another monster (the one with a very altered jaw; Obscuroth). As he kills it, Shalkoc hears a voice in his mind again. Almost motherly, it says: <em>I sense your confusion, and it is alright. Many souls arrive still carrying the shadows of conflict. But that creature… it was just another soul, like you, perhaps a little lost in its own way. Let us try a gentler path to understanding. </em>When he shares the message into the telepathic bond, I feel sick… and increasingly angry.</p><p>Fade runs towards the slashed Bloater and leaps out of the shadows to bite it, before fading into the darkness once more. Plex barely survives being digested by using his Abjurer's Bangle. He throws an immovable spear into the Bloater's stomach, then gets out by using Fey Step. Emilio blasts maggots and another invisible Obscuroth. He then also hears something in his mind and shares it to us: <em>Please, children, there is no need for such harshness in this place of healing. Let understanding be your weapon, not violence. </em>Healing?! I'm going to MURDER this thing! Emilio blasts the Obscuroth all the harder; it responds with a Psionic Rebuke, but Emilio saves.</p><p>I slap a Chill Touch on the Bloater, but it's not enough to kill it. I back off just before Aviana slashes it again; it collapses and explodes in a burst of acid. Aviana goes down the right-hand tunnel and finds… a cloud of magical darkness. She decides to CHARGE INTO IT. She hits a flesh wall, and attacks the darkness. A Walleye spots her, and fires a Psychic Ray at her. She resists the charming, and continues into the darkness. Plex is calling out in the telepathic bond… none of us knows where he is. I'm sticking with my friends and letting Fade scout.</p><p>One of the Obscuroths attacks Emilio, breaking invisibility. He reacts with a Hellish Rebuke, frying it where it stands. Shalkoc… catches… a Psychic Ray… and tries to slap a Bloater, to no avail. He dashes, slaps again, but his hand only meets a wall with a disappointing wet sound. Fade takes some acid damage, shakes herself to get rid of the acid, and runs up almost to Aviana. There is a Walleye there, it casts Darkness, nobody can see Aviana anymore. There is also an Obscuroth there, but Aviana scares the wits out of it. That's how we figure out it still had wits of a sort. Knowing that does not help in the slightest, because it indicates that there is maybe a person enduring in the monsters…</p><p>Plex casts Maelstrom, trapping Shalkoc in it while the Bloater escapes the spell almost unscathed… The Dragonborn exclaims \"What the hell? I'm coming to save you!\" I call out to Plex and try to find him, but in my haste I run right into the line of sight of a Walleye… The Psychic Ray hurts, but I resist the charm. I asked Emilio to stay close to me, he confirms he will follow. Aviana shouts out to me, but she is not in the telepathic bond and I'm too far to hear. She swaps her Spirit Beast's Blessing to Tiger. She pokes a Walleye, then grabs it. She jabs her thumbnail into the eye, making it lose concentration. The darkness disappears but Aviana still can't see a thing.</p><p>Another Psychic Ray shoots out of the wall; I ignore the pain, barely keeping concentration, and resist the charm with all my might. Fearghas tries to find Aviana; why did we split up agaaaaaain?! He blasts an Obscuroth with a Ray of Frost, then laughs at it magically. \"You've got a face like a burst kebab!\" He says, dealing psychic damage. Shalkoc takes damage from Plex' Maelstrom. We take care of one another in this party… Shalkoc delivers a bonk on the Bloater with enough force to stun it, then punches it a lot more for good measure.</p><p>Fearghas points out an enemy for Fade. She crits her bite, but doesn't manage to kill it, and fades (haha) into the shadows again. The invisible monster hits her hard in response; she is very close to dissolving into darkness. Plex drinks one repulsive potion to heal himself (it's snot), then casts Sapping Sting on the Bloater. I step right up to the edge of the Maelstrom and throw my +2 dagger at the Bloater. It hits! The monster still stands, barely. Aviana squeezes the Walleye she is grappling, piercing it with her talons. It's still not dead, so she jumps in place, causing one massive blast from her Thunderfeet Footwraps. It hits her too, and she yanks the eyeball out of the wall.</p><p>Fearghas once more laughs at the invisible Obscuroth, which barely fails to kill it. \"Naami, your cat's got this,\" he says and walks away. He finds Aviana, who chucks him the eye she ripped from the wall. Shalkoc is still unable to escape Plex' spell. This is getting embarrassing… Shalkoc goes into the centre of the Maelstrom to punch the Bloater to death. It explodes, but Shalkoc dodges the acid blast. Turns out, Fade hasn't got this. Her bite misses, and the Obscuroth kills her. My poor Fade dissolves into dark mist.</p><p>Emilio launches three blasts against the Walleye that'd been hitting me every turn, but it reflects one of them onto me. It hurts… but I can finally see Plex! Heedless of the cost, I extend a hand towards him… the magic takes my blood to fuel a healing spell. I don't care. Plex' wounds are healed, and a voice speaks in my head: <em>Such selfless acts are the very essence of Nirvana. You bring joy to this tranquil place with your innate kindness. You understand already</em>. I am livid… but suspicion begins to sneak in. Is this the demon speaking, or is it something worse?</p><p>Aviana runs past me, and attracts the attention of the Walleye. Emilio asks me for permission, but he won't say what for. I yell at him that this is not a time to keep secrets. Fearghas backs me up, but Emilio refuses to speak. I'm very upset with everyone except Fearghas. Emilio is hit by the Walleye, and reacts with a Hellish Rebuke. Aviana hears something come towards us… something huge, stomping with meaty sounds. Emilio stammers that it's bigger than Aviana. The monster (Major Malleable) grabs her; she calls Shalkoc to come help. Plex casts a spell of Detect Thoughts to try to locate the enemy, but the range is too short. Plex is eating the maggots again… he convulses, and collapses, unconscious. Uncontrolled terror blinds me for a second, my mind flooded in memories and overwhelming dread. Do I even dare healing him? What if…</p><p>Emilio blasts the Major. I run to Plex and examine him… he is afflicted by a form of madness that will last 8 minutes. A spell of Calm Emotions or Lesser Restorations can cure this! Just as I figure this out, a spellgem begins to glow in Plex' pocket, reanimating him. I yell at him as Aviana dares him to eat another maggot. I heal some of my own wounds, but my magic feels weak, my hands are shaking. I don't think using healing magic on Plex would have harmed him… but the dread that overwhelmed my mind for a moment is not entirely gone. It will get worse. I need to get a grip.</p><p>Aviana flexes and makes her cloak billow. Only Emilio sees this because of the magical darkness. She grabs the Major and drags it out of the darkness. She jumps with it, landing in a blast of thunder. That monster is not only huge… it's amorphous, with organs that don't belong in their places… I've seen the like before… I have seen… I see Aviana's wounds, and all my fear returns in a rush as the Major attacks her and grapples her. Half of her wounds would kill me.</p><p>Fearghas chugs a Potion of Maximum Power, and casts Scorching Ray. Three powerful rays of flame hit the Major. Shalkoc repeatedly punches the Major, and realises it is completely immune to acid damage. Plex casts a level 7 Tether Essence on Shalkoc and Aviana. They willingly fail the save, letting the spell take effect. Emilio pummels the Major with three blasts, exploding in purple clouds. The misshapen creature collapses and dies.</p><p>Finally, the chaos ends… for now. Fearghas begins to cast Leomund's Tiny Hut as a ritual… and the voice speaks up in our heads again: <em>Yes, pause and breathe in the tranquility, dear ones. The transition from the River to the boundless peace of Nirvana can be… intense. Rest is a balm, and I am here to offer comfort and guidance. </em>Fearghas grumbles that this demon is weird. Aviana casts Find Traps and says that the walls are traps, the floor is a trap, the ceiling is a trap… everything around us is a trap of confusion, disorientation, madness, acid, suffocation, poison, infestation with maggots, exhaustion, blindness, and losing the ability to escape.</p><p>Aviana requests Plex to bite her. I draw my dagger and threaten her with it, telling her to sit still and let me heal her. The voice tells us: <em>Please, try to be calm. Such reactions are echoes from the world you left behind. Here, in Nirvana, all spirits are to be cherished and guided with kindness.</em> I snarl at it to shut up. Shalkoc casts Cure Wounds on Aviana, which pleases the voice. Plex bites Aviana. Fearghas starts violently scolding Aviana and Plex, with good reason.</p><p>We attempt a short rest, and heal up. Fearghas pulls out his void explorer spellbook. Emilio glares at it for a second; his hands twitch and he struggles for a moment, then transforms into his Void Form. The white of his eyes go black and the bandages on his hands burst open, revealing wicked claws. Eldritch energies spark around his claws. Plex freaks out and pushes Emilio away and out of the bubble with his telekinesis, knocking him prone in the bargain. We question him, but he growls that this is his real form, and there are more important matters to take care of.</p><p>As Emilio is thrown out of the hut, he sees that the hallway behind us… looks nothing like it used to. Shalkoc begins to cook an eyeball cake for Aviana, with very little concern. Our wizards figure out that teleportation and planar travel do not work here. We're trapped.</p><p>As we settle down to rest, the voice speaks again: <em>Rest now, little spirits, you've just navigated the currents of the River of Souls. It's not uncommon to feel a little bewildered upon arrival. All is well here.</em> I am convinced now that this is not the demon speaking, but a celestial from Nirvana. While we sit and rest, the magical darkness moves towards us. The celestial (?) speaks about the light of dawn as the darkness is coming closer.</p>"

          "content": "<p>Emilio's white hair seemed to glow in the dimness, a patch of clean snow on a backdrop of reddish hell. He raised his bandaged hand as if to curse the twisted creature that had Aviana in a chokehold; three bursts of energy leapt from his fingers and exploded on the mass of bulging flesh and organs. Clouds of purple smoke erupted, and the creature shuddered and collapsed, remaining still. It did not look like it had ever been alive, or even moving. It looked like a tangle of surgical mistakes, or insane experiments. It looked like madness clad in flesh, a chunk that had been torn off from this place. Aviana, finally free, began to argue with Plex. Naami started towards her, unable to look away from the wounds covering the harpy from talons to wingtips.</p>\n<p>\"I'll give us a semblance of safety so we can recuperate,\" Fearghas grumbled.</p>\n<p>Spellbook in hand, he began to mutter and trace sigils into the air, raising a familiar barrier around the party. Just then, the voice spoke into their heads again: <em>Yes, pause and breathe in the tranquillity, dear ones. The transition from the River to the boundless peace of Nirvana can be… intense. Rest is a balm, and I am here to offer comfort and guidance.</em></p>\n<p>\"That demon's weird,\" the dwarf said once the protective bubble was complete.</p>\n<p>\"Let me cast a spell of trap detection,\" Aviana said, frowning in concentration. \"Ah, I see! The walls are traps. The floors are traps, and the ceiling is a trap, too. Now the danger of these traps is… are… confusion and disorientation, madness, acid, suffocation… errrm… poison, infestation with maggots, also exhausting, blindness… and losing the ability to escape. Well. Plex, can you bite me?\"</p>\n<p>Naami stared, her argument forgotten. Aviana the unbreakable harpy was bleeding and bruised, covered in acid burns, and she wanted to be <em>bitten</em> on top of it? Plex, who had been shrunk to the size of a rat by a wild magic surge, started to argue that he was too small to have a chance to even break the skin. Likely he still would be, even at his normal size. Plex, who had teleported away the moment we arrived here, <em>willingly</em>, and nearly got himself eaten, digested, and killed, in any order. Twice. Plex, whom Naami had healed at the cost of her own blood. She had been so relieved to see him alive, her control on magic had slipped, and she had transferred her life force to him, closing all his wounds. Plex was nonchalantly agreeing to more violence, only discussing the logistics of it, as Aviana was urging him to hit her.</p>\n<p>In the madness of the situation, Naami's fear flashed to anger. She wished she could brush off her actions as consequences of emotion, as losing control of herself; a form of madness maybe. That would be a lie. She deliberately drew her sharp dagger. She decided to stalk to Aviana and point that dagger at her. Oh, she was much too small to threaten the harpy, grown to a huge size by alchemy. But a threat needed not be made on a person's life, and some wounds were worse than death. Naami angled her blade at Aviana's heels, where a small cut would be as severing her feet from her legs. She could heal a snapped tendon, though it would cost her.</p>\n<p>\"Aviana, you sit still now and let me heal those wounds, or I promise I will make you.\"</p>\n<p>Just then, Plex worked out how to hit Aviana, and followed through with it, whacking her with his staff. She did not flinch, and Naami was past paying attention to it, but that did not stop Aviana from requesting Naami stab her with the dagger she had just threatened her with. </p>\n<p>Before she could reply, the gentle voice spoke in Naami's mind; <em>Please, try to be calm. Such reactions are echoes from the world you left behind. Here, in Nirvana, all spirits are to be cherished and guided with kindness.</em> </p>\n<p>\"Shut up!\" the Halfling snarled.</p>\n<p>At the party's confusion, she shared the message telepathically, shaking in anger. That demon! How dare it! She fought to stoke her anger and keep it burning. She had to be furious, because fear was encroaching on the edges of her anger. She could not let her suspicions take form. Oh goddess, these were an angel's words. A demon would not know or care about the River of Souls, or Nirvana. It was an angel's voice. Not again, please, not again. Naami realised she was shaking too much to treat her friend's wounds. Shalkoc stepped in next to her, and with a gentle nod to Naami, cast a healing spell on Aviana. The wordless help brought her close to tears.</p>\n<p>The voice spoke in reply to Shalkoc's spell: <em>How wonderful! Your spirit already resonates with the compassion that flows through Nirvana. Such kindness is a true sign of your innate goodness.</em></p>\n<p>\"Oh, thank you,\" Shalkoc says. \"We could be friends!\"</p>\n<p>Aviana agreed, but Fearghas snapped at Aviana, Shalkoc, and Plex.</p>\n<p>\"Have you three not been paying attention? You've been running amok since we arrived here, teleporting all over the place. We are fighting for our lives here! That thing is a demon! It is not a friend! It warps the very bodies and minds of its prey. Naami told you what it does, and look how traumatised she is! No one is going to hit you any more, Aviana. We need you in fighting shape.\"</p>\n<p>\"But my spirit is all down, I need someone to slap some sense into me. Someone weak, not you Shalkoc, your punches hit like a boulder.\"</p>\n<p>Fearghas rubbed his temples with deliberate slowness. Emilio stared in utter confusion as Aviana continued to argue that it was truly a power she possessed, although she did not understand how it worked. With a carefully blank expression, Fearghas handed out healing potions, which seemed to finally stop this madness. The insanity only continued in the shape of the voice congratulating Aviana and Plex on a friendly trade of copper coins for a bottle of what could only be bright green snot.</p>\n<p>\"Naami, out of curiosity,\" Fearghas said in a weary voice, \"was the one you met before like this?\"</p>\n<p>\"It wasn't… I've suspected for a while, this isn't the demon talking. It's too long a game for a demon to play… they don't act like that.\"</p>\n<p>\"So that demon took control of a celestial?\" Emilio said.</p>\n<p>\"Or worse,\" Naami said, shaking.</p>\n<p>She tried to drown her fear in familiar motions, applying healing salve to Aviana's wounds and to her own. It was not as good as magic but… her magic, her life force, was limited. She had to hold onto it for when there would be no time for slower forms of healing. As she worked, the emotions faded to the background, her attention fully on the motions of her fingers, but there was only so much salve she could apply to any wound. The thoughts came back the moment she was done, and this time she was powerless to silence them.</p>\n<p>\"It's really an angel,\" Naami said, her voice distant in her ears. \"It's trapped here, and deceived.\"</p>\n<p>Summoned by the words, memories came rushing back into her mind. Her hands rose unbidden to her head, tangling into her hair. She tried to close her eyes, but it was worse. Opening them to the same nightmare that haunted her made her want to scream. She only managed a whimper. \"Not again, not again, not again…\" Seeming to materialise out of the shadows, Emilio appeared beside her. His voice sank into a soft whisper, unlike even the reserved personality he had shown until now. Despite a splinter of cold in his voice, it was reassuring.</p>\n<p>\"Don't let them get you,\" he said. \"You are who you are, no matter what.\"</p>\n<p>His eyes were drawn to movement in front of him, as Fearghas pulled a heavy tome from his pack. Complex patterns on the covers were shifting, and the entire book seemed to hum. Naami looked up to see Fearghas calmly skimming through the book, its pages covered in a tight script alternating with maps that seemed to move as she tilted her head. Star charts? She had used them before, to gather herbs during the right phases of the moon, but the charts she had seen did not twist and change under her eyes…</p>\n<p>Next to her, Emilio went stiff as a statue, glaring at the spellbook in the dwarf's hands. His bandaged hands twitched, he seemed to shudder, and… he changed. Darkness like ink spilled into the white of his eyes, leaving the purple irises glowing in a sea of blackness. The bandages burst, revealing wicked claws set with a glowing purple gem like an eye, wrapped in crackling energy. With a squeak, the tiny Plex summoned his telekinesis and shoved Emilio out of the protection of Fearghas' spell.</p>\n<p>\"What in the nine hells?\" Fearghas exclaimed. \"Emilio, what happened to you?\"</p>\n<p>\"Nothing. This is my true form.\" Emilio's voice had a rough, cold edge.</p>\n<p>\"Was this the secret you were keeping from us?\" Naami said, face pale.</p>\n<p>\"Maybe it was.\"</p>\n<p>\"What <em>are</em> you?\" She cried.</p>\n<p>\"I think we have more urgent matters to deal with,\" the warlock growled.</p>\n<p>An awkward silence stretched before Fearghas admitted, reluctantly, that he was right. Unfazed, Shalkoc offered to cook some food for Aviana, who immediately asked for a spicy snack. At the utter lack of concern from his friends, Fearghas beckoned Emilio back into the protective bubble.</p>\n<p>\"We need to make sure Emilio doesn't attack us, right?\" Aviana said in the middle of discussing chilies with Shalkoc.</p>\n<p>\"If I wanted you dead, you would be,\" he said, his black and purple eyes showing no emotion. \"Besides… we need to get rid of whatever is in control here, <em>fast</em>. The tunnels are already changing.\"</p>\n<p>He pointed at the warped tunnel behind him, twisted into nothing like the place the party had entered from.</p>\n<p>\"T-that's what they do,\" Naami stammered. \"They change the corridors… just like last time…\"</p>\n<p>\"That's not all,\" Plex said. \"My curse… is silent here.\"</p>\n<p>Fearghas went very still. Naami felt the magic around him shift, just subtly, without forming a spell. The two wizards exchanged a look, then Fearghas spoke:</p>\n<p>\"Teleportation magic will not work here. Or planar travel.\"</p>\n<p>\"We're trapped here?\" Naami squeaked.</p>\n<p>\"Well, we can't run away,\" Fearghas said.</p>\n<p>With a sigh, the party settled down to rest. There was little else they could do, after all. Naami sat very gingerly on the repulsive floor, trying to avoid the pulsating parts. She found a patch that seemed less squishy and, doing her utmost to ignore the resemblance with scar tissue, sat cross-legged for just a moment. Her arms still stung from the rush of uncontrolled magic she had directed at Plex; borne on her fear for her friend, the magic had taken her blood as fuel to heal the goblin. Not a lot of thinking had been involved; she had been too far for a spell that was safe for her, and he had been too injured for a weaker spell. Healing… sometimes, healing also meant hurting. Absentmindedly, she drew her dagger, the sharper of the two she carried. The other dagger was forged with magic, but this one was simply of extraordinary quality. It had a long handle formed to fit her hand, and a single-edged blade ending in a sharp tip, an unusual form for a dagger. Oh, she could probably pick a lock or disable a trap with it, not that she knew much of such things, but she would be loath to use this fine a blade in such a crude fashion. The needle point, the razor edge, they were for cutting through skin and muscle. It would slice through tendons with ease, requiring little force as long as her fingers were deft enough to guide the blade to the weaker spots of her target's body. Naami's weapon was a dagger only by name; it was the only weapon a healer needed, a surgeon's blade. She had had it forged at great cost, worth every copper, and she would have paid more if that meant she had it sooner. Her eyes lingered over the perfect edge without seeing it. If only she had had it sooner.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>She had been carried out of a snowstorm and into the relative warmth of an inn, the weak fire on the hearth seeming a blaze of the ninth hell to her frozen limbs. Thoughts slow with cold, she sat close to the flames, dimly remembering to move her toes and fingers. Feeling returned in the form of needles; she gritted her teeth and continued. The alternative did not bear thinking of. As if in answer to her thoughts, the door banged open, letting in howling wind and snow.</p>\n<p>\"Close that door, man!\" Daman snapped at the newcomer.</p>\n<p>\"Healer!\" the man cried, ignoring the door and Daman. \"You have a healer?\"</p>\n<p>Before she knew it, Naami had pushed herself to her feet. Osten was at her side with a steadying hand.</p>\n<p>\"Easy, you still need rest,\" he murmured.</p>\n<p>It warmed her heart, if not her flesh, but she could not stop herself.</p>\n<p>\"I am a healer,\" she said as she tottered to the man.</p>\n<p>He gave her a dubious look, but desperation was stronger than doubt. Not awaiting the innkeeper's permission, he deposited his burden on a nearby table. Wrapped in rags and furs was a boy barely out of childhood, his eyes closed, frost clinging to his eyelashes.</p>\n<p>\"My son,\" the man sobbed. \"We were caught in the blizzard. Frostbite. Please help him, and all I own is yours.\"</p>\n<p>Naami shook her head; she had no need for such promises. She was who she was. Running her hands over the boy, she summoned weak magic to examine him. Having closed the door, Magnus joined her, brushing icicles from his beard. They soon reached the same conclusion.</p>\n<p>\"His life force is tainted,\" Magnus muttered.</p>\n<p>\"Disrupted,\" Naami agreed.</p>\n<p>She said no more out loud, to not frighten the father any more than he was, but Magnus and her knew the boy's condition was severe. Naami gave instructions; Osten helped drag the table closer to the fire while Daman fetched a tub of water. He waved his fingers over it, heating it to boiling in a flash of magic. Gently, Naami and Magnus removed the boy's boots and several layers of wool socks. The right boot was torn at the front, the socks cold and damp. Naami took out some of her herbs, her heart sinking. Even before seeing the boy's blackened toes, she knew herbs would do no good.</p>\n<p>She tried. With Magnus' help and his control over fire, his fine perception of life itself, she tried. She rubbed the boy's feet with a salve and bathed them in warm water. When it failed, she summoned her magic, carefully at first. She was all too aware of her trembling legs, of the cold still trapped under her own skin. Magnus' magic supported hers, a current of warmth and strength under her unsteady weaves. Osten had firmly dragged the boy's father to the side and was distracting him to the best of his ability. Naami was not listening, but her friend's strong voice helped settle her nerves. Daman sat on a stool like it was a throne, observing, keeping watch on the magic itself, a notepad resting on the table before him. Naami wove magic into a simple healing spell, one to invigorate the patient and restore blood flow. The spell sank into the boy's body, but the cold was stronger. She gathered her strength for a spell of higher power, ready to melt the cold within his flesh. Magnus' only hand brushed against her arm.</p>\n<p>\"That's too risky,\" he said in a whisper, glancing at the father. \"There is still a flicker of life there, but the two last toes are dead.\"</p>\n<p>With a start, Naami let go of her spell without completing it. Her friend was right. She should have known. She would have known, if she had not been so cold and so tired. The Halfling bit her lip hard, willing for the pain to restore her concentration. She could not afford to mess this up. The father's anxious, short replies to Osten's chatter intruded into her concentration. The boy's shallow breathing was suddenly louder to her ears. His eyelids trembled, then opened to reveal hazel eyes clouded with confusion.</p>\n<p>\"Where am I?\" he said. \"Where is Dad?\"</p>\n<p>\"Your Da's right here, lad,\" Magnus said warmly. \"You'll be able to talk to him in a bit. Just be a little patient.\"</p>\n<p>\"I can't feel my toes,\" the boy whined.</p>\n<p>\"I know it's very scary,\" Magnus said, \"but we're gonna do our best to help.\"</p>\n<p>The dwarf glanced at Naami. She made herself meet his eyes.</p>\n<p>\"You're right,\" she said, her words strangled. \"It's too late.\"</p>\n<p>Using magic would only poison his blood and kill him in minutes. The only hope for the boy's life was to cut off the dead flesh, and heal what still had a chance to be healed. Naami ignored the painful churning in her stomach; she had to think of the practical side. With Magnus' help, she thoroughly examined the boy. Only two of the toes on his right foot were beyond saving. Two toes, on a boy whose voice had not dropped yet… No. Only two toes. He could recover from this, if he survived the procedure.</p>\n<p>\"Osten, we're gonna need space,\" she said, voice void of emotion.</p>\n<p>The knight understood the message, and began leading the father away to the rooms on the first floor. There were protests, the innkeeper got involved, and Naami ignored all of it. She prepared more herbs, salves to stop bleeding, salves to protect from infection, and one mix that would send anyone into a deathlike sleep. Her hands shook only a little as she prepared the mixture, and coaxed the boy to drink it. When he was lying senseless on the table, and she had clean cloth and bandages ready, Naami took a deep breath. Her dagger was plain, the blade nicked, but it would have to do. She hesitated, then also removed her spellwards. Magnus shot her a glare.</p>\n<p>\"If you use this magic, you'll die,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"And if I don't, he will die.\"</p>\n<p>The dwarf exhaled explosively, frustration turning to anger.</p>\n<p>\"I can't tell you what to do,\" he growled, \"but have a care for your own life.\"</p>\n<p>\"I am! I can do this!\"</p>\n<p>Daman looked up from the notes he was taking, face blank.</p>\n<p>\"Magnus is right, Naami. Don't be reckless. You can't save everyone.\"</p>\n<p>\"I can't if I don't try,\" she said between clenched teeth. \"And I'm not alone anyway. Magnus can use healing magic too.\"</p>\n<p>\"I can't heal death,\" he muttered.</p>\n<p>\"No one can,\" Daman snapped. \"Sometimes there is nothing to do.\"</p>\n<p>\"But not now,\" Naami said softly, as if to herself. \"Now there is still a chance for this family, so let me take it.\"</p>\n<p>Daman shrugged and returned to his scribing. Magnus gave Naami a level look.</p>\n<p>\"You better be sure of yourself, lass. The only thing I'm really asking you is, don't make your friends sad. Don't break your family to save strangers.\"</p>\n<p>\"I won't.\"</p>\n<p>\"Then let's be about it,\" he sighed.</p>\n<p>Naami completed the preparations; cleaning up as much as possible, and asking Magnus to prepare certain spells. She hardly needed to say what she wanted him to do; they had worked together for some time. She stalled as much as she dared, but the inevitable moment came when she held the point of her dagger on the boy's skin. She aimed at the joint between the bones, the weakest point. She let magic fill her mind to calm her nerves, then leaned on the dagger with all her weight.</p>\n<p>The blade sank into flesh and remained stuck. Gritting her teeth, ignoring the boy's whining through the sleeping draught, she whacked the dagger's pommel. It took two more tries before it bit into the wood with a thud. Despite Magnus' magic, the bleeding was already severe. There was simply no time. She applied the blade to the second toe, trying to wish more strength into her arms. It took only two tries then, but the cuts were uneven, the edges mangled by the chipped blade. Dropping the dagger, she set to weaving a healing spell. There was so much blood. The boy's face grew bone-white, his whimpers fading into silence. Naami summoned more power into her spell, power to knit wounds and restore life force. In the urgency of the moment, she paid no mind to the flood of magic rushing through her. She only rarely took off her spellwards, and in a crisis she acted on instinct fuelled by training and habit. Her spell blossomed into a torrent of positive energy, closing the wounds in a heartbeat. The boy's breathing steadied, colour returned to his cheeks. Dimly, Naami heard Magnus curse in tones of awe. She knew what he must be seeing; she felt it, a tiny circle of life with power over death, between her and the child. Life flowed from her into him, and the cold in his flesh lost ground until it was gone. She knew that in a sense, she had taken the shadow of death from him, and settled it on her instead. She knew that, and all the light around her was swallowed in a tide of silent darkness.</p>\n<p>Naami awoke to a lumpy mattress and scratchy blankets. When she tried to raise her head, the small room spun around her. Voices came from the corridor, one angry and the other soothing.</p>\n<p>\"… told her! The idiot! She hardly controls her magic without those bracelets, but she had to!\"</p>\n<p>\"She had to, and you know it.\"</p>\n<p>\"She can die for all I care! Burn herself out with that magic!\"</p>\n<p>\"You don't mean that, Magnus.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mean it! That's easy for you to say! You can't see the weaves. The sheer amount of power she pulled into herself… do you have <em>any</em> idea…?\"</p>\n<p>An uncomfortable silence. Then Osten replied, in a much quieter voice, \"No, I don't. But she is alive, and so is the boy.\"</p>\n<p>Boots thudded on the floor, then the door opened, letting the tall knight in.</p>\n<p>\"Naami.\" He rushed to her side and knelt by her bed. \"How do you feel?\"</p>\n<p>\"Like an idiot?\" she said, the words refusing to come out quite right.</p>\n<p>\"I suppose you would,\" Osten chuckled. \"Don't mind Magnus. He is only frightened for you. When you fainted, he panicked.\"</p>\n<p>\"He… is right,\" she said reluctantly. \"It was foolish. Reckless. I was a fool.\"</p>\n<p>\"If you know it, that's a step in the right direction. Just make sure the next step follows suit.\"</p>\n<p>She nodded, her thoughts sluggish. Osten told her that the boy was alive and well, that he would walk again, if with a cane or a prosthetic. The father had burst into tears and sworn before the gods to pay with all he owned, cradling his boy. Daman had wanted to accept before Osten stepped in. Naami stared at the ceiling, listening with one ear. Her hands hurt with the memory of cutting the boy's toes; she feared she would be sick. The frayed edges of the wounds haunted her mind. It had all worked out in the end, but only because she had put her own life in danger. She hoped there would never be another situation like this one. She knew it was foolish hope, a dangerous wish. What she needed was time to recover her strength, and right after that, a new dagger. A sharper one.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Sharp pain brought Naami's mind back to the present, to the nightmare she was trapped in. She looked down to a nicked finger, and a drop of red on her sharp dagger. She fought down the urge to giggle as she cleaned the small cut; she feared her laugh might escape her control and spin into a mad cackle. She hoped they would make it out alive. No. She hoped they would destroy that demon, and she hoped her hand would be the one to end it. Her staff spoke of forgiveness; she recalled the dawn of the day she had found it, and the soothing cooing of doves. Her crime was forgiven, but the stain on her soul refused to fade, enduring in nightmares and breathless moments of panic. Redemption, she thought, was not a one-time thing; it was a choice, and she wanted to make that choice as many times as she could.</p>\n<p>She sheathed her blade, remembering with a shudder that she had threatened a friend with it. She could not lose her nerve again. Naami patiently put herself through the breathing exercises that were part of Ildic witches' training. Her mind strayed, but she brought it back to the task every time. It was not foolish to have hope. It was not! As long as she also expected the worst.</p>\n<p>As in answer to her grim thought, the gentle voice spoke in everyone's minds: <em>Rest now, little spirits, you've just navigated the currents of the River of Souls. It's not uncommon to feel a little bewildered upon arrival. All is well here.</em> And as if on cue, the shining darkness crept closer.</p>"

          "name": "75 - There are TOO MANY fluids!!",
          "section": "journal-pages",
          "content": "<p>Fearghas crushes a gem of Mind Blank and smears the dust on my forehead. I am excluded from the telepathic bond, but immune to psychic damage, charmed, mind reading, and scrying spells. Shalkoc makes me a batch of… meat… cookies? Lacking in crunch, they are surprisingly tasty. I try to not wonder too much where the meat comes from. Plex pulls out a stash of Silver Tears and requests something in exchange for them, which makes Fearghas grumble. After trading with our goblin for cocaine, Fearghas casts Foresight on Shalkoc to give him the power of the Echo and advantage on pretty much everything. I give Aviana a root to eat and recover 21 HP. She claims I am the only one who cares about healing her, which is not only false but mildly pisses off Shalkoc (understandably).</p><p>Clouds of magical darkness drift past us. We're already completely lost in the maze of shifting corridors… We eventually gather our courage and leave the bubble. As we walked along a narrow hallway, then walked back, we found a wall. Then another wall as we turned around. The ground started to open up, a puddle of blood forming, sizzling like acid. Emilio and Fearghas start to feel unwell. The hallway in front of us opens up and the walls around us twist and shake with growing intensity. A cloud of darkness comes towards us! Just in time, Emilio warns us of a creature in the darkness, then says the wall blinked, removing one of the Walleyes.</p><p>Emilio goes ahead and describes a lake of blood to us in the darkness, and a big creature ahead. There is a snake-like creature in the pool, along with body parts and, below the surface, items like in a waste pool. We wonder if there is a stomach up ahead, I interject that this is not a real creature we are in. Emilio fires his three blasts into the darkness, and hits another Major Malleable. A snake made of guts slithers from the blood pool and up the wall. The Slithering Bowel (eat dirt, Aerelia) sprays digestive fluids at Emilio, he dodges most of it.</p><p>Aviana walks up to Emilio; the tunnels are barely wide enough for her. She casts Resistance on herself, then takes out the dented iron flask and holds it at the ready. One of the eyes on the wall glares at Emilio with such intensity that he is charmed. I heal him of his poison, then apply Piercing the Veil. Emilio turns to me and says that now he is not the only one cursed with knowledge. Shalkoc tries to blindly punch the Slithering Bowel, but misses, punches a hole into the wall that immediately closes itself. Another of those abominations spits a tooth at Shalkoc, who deflects it onto the other bowel. It spits another spray of digestive fluid at us. I am so disgusted I dodge it close to perfectly, but Plex on my shoulder is not so lucky and gets a whole drop on him.</p><p>Plex and Emilio are blinded by the acid. Emilio is hit by more acid, and dazed. Fearghas mumbles at the back, and then casts a Lightning Bolt, under my direction. His spell only grazes us harmlessly, but it hits two bowels and the Obscuroth from last time that we didn't chase. It was just chilling invisible at 1 HP. F in the chat. It appears as its corpse drops on the shore of the blood lake. Shalkoc is grabbed by something exceedingly fleshy and dragged into the acid pool. He managed \"elp\" before he got attacked by a Major Malleable.</p><p>The walls are spasming violently, tripping Emilio who was already blinded, charmed, and dazed. From the ground, he shoots three blasts at… Fearghas? They all miss, and Emilio shakes himself from his daze. He breaks free from the Walleye's charm too, but he is still lying prone. One of the slithering bowels spits acid at us, blinding Emilio and Plex all over again. Aviana works herself into a rage and steps into the darkness and grabs a bowel, at Emilio's urging to tear it apart (he is very sick of being blinded). She can't see through the darkness, and steps into the blood pool. She struggles out and climbs up on the wall, still squeezing the bowel, shouting to Shalkoc all the while.</p><p>Shalkoc gets hit by the Walleyes' psychic ray, but deflects it. He still gets charmed. I start towards Emilio to heal him, but as I do so, a wild magic surge surrounds me in magical darkness. I'm distracted and my spell comes out weak; the spasming walls trip me and I stumble next to the warlock. Plex falls off my shoulder squeaking. I grit my teeth and channel a Healing Word on Emilio, doing some actual healing this time, but ANOTHER wild magic surge makes me allergic to cloth. I am wearing cloth. My eyes are just streaming at my own dress, and the channelling fatigue hits hard.</p><p>Not my day.</p><p>Plex dodges the meat folds in the ground, and climbs back up on my shoulder. He casts, blindly, Ice Storm. Aviana dodges it, but the terrain is all slippery now. Shalkoc is charmed by the Walleye, but uses Stillness of Mind to remove it. And that's another surge, the next dog he sees in in fact, god. Anagrams, y'all. He is still being grappled by the Major Malleable in the acidic blood pool; as Fearghas puts it, \"gently caressed by the meatball\".</p><p>Fearghas is tripped by the spasming walls, jumps to his feet, and uses a spellgem of Dispel Magic to clear up the magical darkness around me. It's a big relief… although my dress still itches and makes my eyes water. Grappled by the malleable, Shalkoc is being drained of his spirit so hard that even his max HP would be reduced, but he uses a mythic power to resist it. Another cloud of magical darkness erupts from the Major Malleable, from the same wild magic surge I got a minute ago. Emilio is still prone but gets up at last. He is pissed off and goes into Void Form of his own accord. He stumbles into the icy area left by Plex, and fires Eldritch Blast on the Slithering Bowel. The latter wriggles free from Aviana's grapple and slithers away. Aviana smacks her talon down on it and crushes it before it can escape.</p><p>She calls out to Shalkoc, leaving one cloud of magical darkness and stepping into another one. Shalkoc calls for help, he is being grappled. She grabs the Major Malleable that is holding Shalkoc, and drags it, then jumps while holding it. \"Shalkoc, do not resist,\" she says, as Shalkoc is dragged along, through the air, and takes heavy damage from the Cursed Thunderfeet when Aviana lands. The Walleye sees Aviana get too close, and becomes very uncomfortable. It casts Darkness.</p><p>I channel my summoning spell and call a powerful form of Fade to help in the battle. Emilio describes to Plex where the enemies are as he loads up a Gravity Fissure. Plex is no longer blinded, but he can't see through magical darkness like we do. I point Plex at the monsters like a gun. Aviana, Shalkoc, and the Walleye dodge, but both Major Malleables fail. Fade runs towards one of the Major Malleables, hunting by sound, and bites it hard, then becomes invisible. Shalkoc punches the Malleable to death and chugs a potion of speed. He vibrates out of the grapple and punches the other Malleable very hard, you might say critically so, then shifts to Turtle Stance and moves back, screaming he needs help.</p><p>Now that the Dragonborn is close, I see his injuries are critical! Just then, a Slithering Bowel spits acid from behind us, blinding me and Shalkoc. Plex dodges it somehow. Fearghas dodges the spasming walls with impressive agility. He puts on his Glasses of True Seeing, and chugs a potion of Maximum Power. The Malleable shuffles towards Shalkoc, stepping over my invisible Fade. It hits Shalkoc, who shields himself with his Protective Wings.</p><p>Emilio gets to the Malleable and starts tearing it apart with his claws. I only hear concerning slashing sounds… Aviana grabs the Walleye and squeezes it, then pushes her talons into it. She is pulling it out of the wall and almost has it out, but a bit at the back is still sticking. I wobble towards Shalkoc, blind but guided by Fearghas. Plex is shouting into my ear a lot of lines to the general effect of \"let me at 'em!\" He is distracting me and I step into the pool of acidic blood… Metal crunches under my feet. I cast Heal on Shalkoc, unseasoned because I am spending way too many resources already.</p><p>Plex chugs a Potion of Heroism. None of us like where this is going. Plex grimaces like he is ready to bite. Level 13 Wizard by the way. I hope he does not bite me… Fade shreds the Bowel with her teeth and knocks it prone, but doesn't manage to kill it. Shalkoc brutally slaps the Bowel, which attempts to slither away into a hole under the acid blood. Emilio slashes it on its way, killing it.</p><p>Fearghas' magic reaches to Aviana, ripping blood from her and crystallising it into three spikes that stab the Malleable to death, and pin the corpse against a nearby wall. Aviana says \"hey the walls are helping us!\". A mouth in the wall opens up and replies \"No we're not.\". I stare at Fearghas in shock. I climb onto the fleshy island in the middle of the blood pool to get out of the acid. Something revolting bursts under my hand, and Emilio lends me a steadying… errr… claw. The celestial speaks to us; I try to answer, but Emilio snaps at it.</p><p>Now that we can see again, we can distinguish what is at the bottom of the blood pool. Low-quality clothes and chains like that of the slaves in Ukgluz, some useless items… and a lot of coins. Some of the coins are too deep to pick up without diving, but Fearghas uses Mage Hand.We estimate that there are around 9700 gold coins in there! Aviana casts Find Traps, with the same result as before; everything is a trap.</p><p>The problem is time. How much time are we willing to sacrifice to fish out gold coins? There are other items in the blood pool, stuck in the crevices so someone will have to dive down to retrieve it. There is a silk robe embroidered in gold, untouched by the acid. There is also jewelry, potentially magical. Fearghas casts Guidance on Aviana, she casts Resistance on herself, and prepares to dive to retrieve anything of value (that isn't money). She spots a gold chain with an opal set inside, and a gold locket. The harpy dives in, pushes the flaps of meat aside and retrieves all three items, taking minimal damage in the process, as she is resistant to acid.</p><p>Emilio picks up the gold chain set with the fire opal, and Aviana takes the gold locket with a painted portrait inside, as well as the silk robe with gold embroidery. Emilio is mesmerised by the fire opal. We start walking, trying and failing to find our way. The tunnel shrinks, space is getting too tight for comfort… we can either let it squeeze us into a direction, or try to resist and stand our ground. Fearghas breaks a gem of Leomund's Tiny Hut, shielding us all within a dome of force. The walls begin to crush the dome; if we had tried to resist this, we would probably have suffocated. The bubble doesn't move, and after about three minutes, the walls expand again. We move on.</p><p>We reach another area of magical darkness. Emilio and Fearghas walk in, I hesitate next to Shalkoc. Behind us, Aviana hears a trickling, then a rushing. A wall of greenish bile floods the tunnel towards us. We brace for it and withstand it, but Fearghas and Emilio are swept away, pushed into a wall, and dragged along. Fearghas manages to hold on, but Emilio is pushed farther from us, unable to find his footing. (he's failed 6 saves at this point and we are screaming)</p><p>Something tries to snatches Emilio before he can be swept into a hole but he wriggles out and falls into the hole. HE FINALLY SAVES, holding onto teeth at the edge of the maw. He pulls himself up and out of the gaping maw at the cost of extensive acid burns. Left behind, Shalkoc starts to stumble through the magical darkness. He uses Step of the Wind to catch up to Emilio, but I lose sight of him completely.</p><p>I cast Piercing the Veil and advance through the magical darkness. Fade caught up to us, she is invisible but her presence reassures me. Less so Plex' on my shoulder, but he hands me two bottles of very dark wine as thanks for carrying him. To maintain the balance of trade, I hand him a torch. I don't think it will help him see through the magic-wrought darkness, but it's symbolic, right? I'm worried about Emilio, I'm sure he is injured. I need to get to him. Fearghas went ahead of me, and caught up to him and Shalkoc. I can't be too far behind.</p><p>Plex drinks some of the same dark wine. The magic around him shifts, shapes into a spell just short of casting. An invisible Obscuroth slides just in front of us, and Plex releases his Thunderwave… triggering a MAJOR WILD MAGIC SURGE. THAT BLINDS ANYONE WITHIN 60 FEET OF PLEX. I'll need a 9th-level spell to remove that!</p><p>An unfinished flesh golem is speaking to Emilio and Fearghas, begging to be left alone because it's been tortured so much, all its scales ripped of. It has the head of a juvenile dragon, on a humanoid body. The Dragonflesh golem unleashes an Elemental breath on Emilio, knocking the life out of him. The golem cries that he is sorry, then returns to being an emotionless golem.</p><p>Aviana tears through the wall of flesh, emerging next to the others whom I was trying to catch up to! Fearghas shouted that Emilio was down, from the shouts I hear, he could be dying. Fearghas shouts to Aviana to put Emilio in the flask. Shalkoc runs up to Emilio and feeds him snot, which revives him with a lot of coughing. He weakly thanks Shalkoc, who is silenced and just gives a thumbs up. The celestial's voice congratulates Shalkoc for pouring snot down Emilio's throat while he was unconscious and dying from his wounds.</p><p>What a time to have ears.</p><p>I dash towards the noise made by my friends, Plex guiding me. How the tables turn. I call out to them and say I'm blind. Unable to cast a spell, I draw my sharp dagger and clutch it for dear life. I hear a Walleye fire a Psychic Ray, and Fearghas grumbles about Wizard bullshit. He summons a Spectral Hand and uses a spellgem of Dimension Door to drop Emilio and Shalkoc next to me, by grabbing them with the very spooky hand. Fearghas joins us, swinging his obsidian battleaxe. Level 13 Wizard by the way.</p><p>Plex offers to Fearghas to buy his Haste Potion. Fearghas retorts \"Plex, do you understand the concept of DYING?\" Aviana is getting attacked by something. Shalkoc gains inspiration as the Dragonflesh golem is proof of the existence of dragons. Plex uses Fey Step and disappears on the other side of a wall. Again. This time he is not far from us, and he casts Gravity Sinkhole. We discuss what to do with the Dragonflesh golem, and decide to put it out of its misery. I argue that I prefer to spend my most powerful spell on my friends rather than attempt to save a creature twisted beyond recognition, that has tried to kill us.</p><p>Plex shunts the Dragonflesh golem into the gaping maw. It screams in terror that it doesn't want to fall into that hole again, then sinks beneath the waves. I feel so sick… The darkness is suffocating… I can't fight it, it comes from my own eyes. Can we survive this? Will we even live to find the Sibriex? I can't break now, I am still needed. An Obscuroth wanders close to Fade, she tears it to shreds. The golem struggles in vain, shouting it doesn't want to go there again, not again. I can't shut out the screams, they sound too much like mine. The last we hear from the golem is that it doesn't want to \"receive any more mercy from that thing\". What a sickening thing to hear…</p><p>Emilio is completely unconcerned with his own survival, and enters Void Form again. I will dose this man with catfern and mavinsleaf if we ever get out of here. Abundantly. He applies Accrued Vitality and gives himself 26 temp HP, so maybe I will maybe it a slightly weaker brew. He slashes at a Bloater that is right in front of us. I get hit by a Tooth Spit from a Slithering Bowel, and dazed, but I keep my concentration on Fade. She dashes to us, but can't attack this turn.</p><p>Aviana shoves a repulsive enemy like Captain Falcon, straight into the maw in the middle of the room. Shalkoc hesitates to kill the Bloater because they explode when they die, he (rightfully so) fears he'll kill us (Emilio and me). I use a Mass Cure Wounds but it turns out to be weak sauce on everyone but me. Since I'm dazed, I can do nothing else…</p><p>Aviana gets critted and recovers a lot of resources! She brings up wanting to be bitten again. Fearghas casts Shocking Grasp on the Bloater, then slices at it with his axe, with precision entirely out of place for a Wizard! He moves away from us, past Fade, and drinks another Potion of Maximum Power. Fearghas spots a kind of flesh… workbench? in the distance. On it rests a heavy tome, and he gets this glint in his eyes…</p><p>Plex pushes the Bloater away from me, but closer to Fearghas. The monster tries to eat Emilio; he takes damage from the bite, then gets swallowed. Plex, still tiny, convincingly shouts at Emilio that he can, in fact, SEE in there! The Bowel next to Aviana tries to slither away, but she kicks it, sending it close enough to attack me, which it does. I take acid damage, and I am dazed again. This time I lose concentration and Fade dissipates in a burst of dark mist. Emilio somehow survives the Bloater's stomach acid but he is still severely injured. In clawing his way out, Emilio kills the Bloater, which explodes in a burst of acid. Our warlock emerges covered in acid, enraged.</p><p>The Bowel spits acid at me again. I can't think for the pain… We finally kill that last Bowel, and combat ends. I'm still blind, so I cling to anyone I can find. Fearghas picks up the tome; a Manual of Fiendish Flesh Golems. It is bound in many kinds of skin. He also finds a cloak woven in dragon scales, which he hands to Emilio. Shalkoc's last remaining braincell whispers to him to not run away on his own. Thank you so much, braincell.</p><p>I'm standing in place, paralysed with fear, when Fearghas walks up to me with a spell scroll and a spellgem, and removes my cloth allergy, and my blindness. I can finally see! And I see the blood in the pool in the middle of the room draining… The celestial's voice speaks to us not in our minds, but from below the pool, welcoming us.</p><p>Fearghas says out loud what we all think; we are in no condition for another fight and we absolutely need to rest. Emilio trades with Plex; one haste potion for Aviana, in exchange for Plex' last surviving chicken, which Emilio held onto. Fearghas prepares to put up the tiny hut, and we settle for a short rest next to the corpses, the acid puddles, and the empty pool of blood.</p>"

          "content": "<p>Aviana and Plex begin to argue, which ends as usual with Aviana grabbing Plex by the throat and squeezing, and them both disappearing. Teleportation out of here is impossible, so we assume they are still in the lair. Fearghas pulls out alchemical supplies, grumbles at our friends' disappearance, and we hear a sound coming from the north-east corridor. Fearghas says the telepathic bond ended when I bring it up, so we go look for them using our little feet, Emilio and I leaving a trail of blood from our injuries. Emilio's blood is black?!</p><p>We follow the twisting corridor to a room where we find a small Malleable that has… wings? Behind it is a large black egg. Emilio and Fearghas immediately blast the Malleable; its body melts into the ground, leaving feathers behind. The egg is warm and has a thin, slimy shell like a snake egg. Fearghas and Shalkoc say it looks nothing like a dragon egg… How do they know that? Not the time to ask. Something is moving sluggishly inside the egg. A humanoid hand seems to try to break through the shell, but is too weak to do so.</p><p>Before Fearghas can advise against this course of action, Emilio punches a hole through the egg, spilling fluid onto Emilio. Inside the egg is a gooey, disheveled… human woman. She is not happy, understandably so. She is small, blonde with green eyes, wearing black armour. Groggily, she asks where she is.</p><p>\"We're in the lair of a demon.\"</p><p>\"At the bottom of a lake.\"</p><p>\"In the Underdark.\"</p><p>5 iridescent feathers on the ground, untouched by the filth.</p><p>The blonde woman introduces herself as Kyrin. She is spooked by Shalkoc, towering over the party. She offers me a healing potion, then upon seeing Emilio, hands it to him instead. No hard feelings. He is hurt even worse than I am. She hands me a second healing potion. Emilio and me drink gratefully; a little of the tension goes out of him.</p><p>We return to the drained blood pool and Fearghas carries out the ritual for Leomund's Tiny Hut. Kyrin examines herself, checking for any unnatural growths that may have occurred while she was in the egg. Her shadow seems… strange. Doesn't move quite right, like it's lagging behind. I speak up, but Fearghas and Kyrin say I'm maybe seeing things. For a moment her shadow looked like mine… I must be imagining. Shalkoc cooks a thankfully vegetarian soup for Emilio and me.</p><p>I patch up Emilio with the bandages and herbs I have, then treat my own wounds. Shalkoc cooks a big medium rare steak for Kyrin, generously spiced with ginger. What meat is that? After handing her food to Kyrin, Shalkoc gives me a very soothing high-five with his Hand of Healing. Fearghas insistently asks Shalkoc where he got the steak from, which makes Kyrin hesitate until Shalkoc assures he bought the steak in the city. Shalkoc cooks more meat, this time some kind of chicken, as a snack for Fearghas.</p><p>The voice calls from the hole: \"Yes, pause and breathe in the tranquility, dear ones. The transition from the River to the boundless peace of Nirvana can be… intense. Rest is a balm, and I am here to offer comfort and guidance.\" Emilio shouts at it to shut up. Fearghas offers him a drink, he refuses. The dwarf insists, and pours him some dwarven ale. Kyrin enquires as to why Emilio is so angry at the voice. His voice seeps barely controlled fury as he speaks about the abysmal luck he's been having.</p><p>I offer to treat the party's remaining scrapes and hurts. They decline, but the celestial speaks in my mind, saying they are impressed with my dedication to heal, and they are eager to teach me to heal even better. I go positively green at that. Fearghas hands out potions of heroism, which we all drink as we steel ourselves.</p><p>The hole in the middle of the room is deep, with slippery walls. Fearghas suggests to cast Feather Fall, and just jump. AAAAAAAAAA. We float down into a large fleshy chamber, very humid and reeking. A big hole in the north wall leads to another chamber, presumably. We hear skittering, squelching steps. There is no sign of the Dragonflesh golem… The voice calls \"There you are, let me tend to you.\" Kyrin crouches behind a fleshy growth, all but disappearing from sight. Fearghas takes a steeling drink. I panic and use Shadowslip to disappear (and a major wild magic surge giving me a permanent 1d8 to my charisma checks!). Shalkoc uses Guardian of Nature: Primal Beast. Emilio glares.</p><p>The skittering comes closer… Hands, followed by elbows, more hands, more elbows… It straightens, a monster of arms and more arms that moves gingerly but dextrously. The monster cradles what remains of a celestial, or rather, many celestials stitched together. Bones sticking out of its fingers make dreadful claws. It asks us to come into its embrace. Emilio is enraged and threatens it. The monster responds with kindness…</p><p>We roll initiative.</p><p>The Perfected Deva takes two steps towards us, then teleports very close! It swings claws at Fearghas saying soothing things, to which Fearghas grumbles heartily. It encourages us to come closer, and sweeps across the entire area with its claws. It hits and grapples Fearghas, restraining him as it pulls him into its loving embrace. Urgh. Emilio gets hit and delivers a spicy Hellish Rebuke in reaction, but the boss saves and takes half damage. Emilio gets grappled as well. I get hit even in shadow form, breaking the spell, and grappled. Shalkoc blocks the attack with his wings. Kyrin is not noticed by the monster at all.</p><p>I resist the curse, try to escape the grapple, but fail. Shalkoc goes into Mantis Style and punches, then attempts to deliver a Stunning Strike, twice. He does damage, but both strikes fail to stun the Deva. He unleashes a Flurry of Blows, triggers Chromatic Hardening, and tries one last Stunning Strike, to no avail. He steps away, unharmed by the monster.</p><p>Emilio resists the curse like it's nothing. He casts Void Torrent, and teleports away; the acid does not seem to harm the Deva at all. He goes into Void Form and uses Accrued Vitality but it's weak sauce and he only gains 8 temp HP. Tragic. Kyrin gets cursed. The Deva tells us to not be afraid, which promptly frightens Shalkoc and me (I rolled with advantage, and thankfully, because that was a 4 and a 1…). Kyrin pulls out a SUN BLADE and swings at the monster in a sneak attack, dealing a ton of radiant damage. She follows it up with a Psychic Blade, but the attack misses. She runs to safety.</p><p>The Deva uses Helping Hand (a claw attack with free necrotic damage and spicy crit range) and crits Fearghas for a massive chunk of HP. He casts Misty Step to get the hell out, leaving me alone in the grapple. He casts Hold Monster from a spellgem.</p><p>\"Aerelia if this thing is immune to paralyse, I'm going to shank you.\" Karnack, 2025.</p><p>We don't find out because the Deva saves, and Fearghas is very upset. The Deva uses Gentle Light, spawning a cloud of magical darkness on Kyrin. The Deva uses To the Rescue, teleporting to Shalkoc and dragging me along. Pressed into its ribcage, I feel squirming underneath the skin. There is a lot of maggots in there… The Deva hits me, it's another crit. I take heavy damage, leaving me at low health with a half-baked plan.</p><p>The Deva has a legendary resistance, and I only get one shot at a healing burst. I levitate myself out of the grapple, run away 20 feet in the air, and apply a healing word on myself, healing barely anything. Shalkoc punches for all he's worth, with a lot of feeling, but does not stun the Deva, so he shifts to Turtle Stance. The Deva uses Don't be Afraid again, but we all endure the wave of fear without flinching. Emilio growls that he has seen much worse in the void, and pummels it with an Eldritch Blast. Two beams hit, and Emilio uses Grasp of Hadar to drag the Deva closer to him.</p><p>The monster unleashes another wave of fear, terrifying Shalkoc and Kyrin. It uses Empathy/Loneliness as a reaction to her failing the save, forcing us to make two other saves which she barely passes, at the cost of light psychic damage. She sidesteps out of the magical darkness and throws a Psychic Blade because she is frightened and unable to move closer.</p><p>The Deva feels lonely and teleports to Kyrin, who flips it off as a free action. \"What a gentle gesture,\" it sighs. \"Oh I've got a gesture for you all right!\" She says. Fearghas steps in cat puke IRL then casts Scorching Ray. It would deal massive damage, but the Deva uses a Legendary Resistance! Then Fearghas chucks a Spiritual Weapon at it. The Deva uses a legendary action to attack Kyrin on Fearghas' turn, she uses her Uncanny Dodge to halve the damage.</p><p>The Deva hits Kyrin again, taking half her life in one blow. She then hits me; I drop to 1 HP and the Death Ward dissipates! I stop concentrating on Levitate and float to the ground. Through the Staff of Power, I cast Wall of Force and put myself in an unbreakable box to buy time. A Healing Word on Shalkoc gives him courage to approach the enemy and punch the living daylight out of it. Emilio gets close and readies up a spell. The Deva uses a Helping Hand on Kyrin, who dodges it perfectly. Close call!</p><p>Kyrin gets an otherworldly inspiration called Karnack; she hides, applies Shadow Strike to increase her reach, then attacks with a melee Psychic Blade, and marks the enemy's soul. She books it to a safe distance. A new wave of fear rolls out from the Deva, but none of us are afraid! Fearghas commands his Spiritual Weapon to attack, then prepares a Scorching Ray.</p><p>Another wave of fear hits us, and this time it's too much for everyone but Fearghas. Shalkoc indirectly saves my life by using a Dreamfeather and allowing me to reroll, avoiding psychic damage from Empathy/Loneliness. Kyrin gets hit by it but saves, barely surviving. On its turn, the Deva goes to her. Shalkoc tries an attack of opportunity, but is hit by a wild magic surge that inflicts disadvantage on all his attack rolls, cancelling the advantage from his future sight. Kyrin gets hit by Helping Hand, and goes down. The Deva jumps back to Shalkoc's rescue and bumps into my Wall of Force. Eyes lock onto me and hands feel at the Wall of Force, looking in vain for an opening. It looks disappointed, but it waits for my barrier to fall off.</p><p>Emilio and Fearghas unleash their readied spells, Tasha's Mind Whip and Scorching Ray. The Deva rolls a critical save on the mind whip and does not use resistance… Five of Fearghas' rays hit, and the Deva uses Legendary Resistance!</p><p>Steeling myself, I drop concentration on the Wall of Force. The hands reach out to me as I am defenseless, critically injured, but I am faster. Ripping my spellwards from my wrists, clutching the Staff of Power, I channel my strongest healing spell. A torrent of positive energy rushes towards the Deva, closing all wounds but also feeding the maggots inside and making them multiply until the creature's skin tears and the disgusting things burst out. The Deva's twisted body crumples, and the ruined face looks up at me. In a last whisper, it says \"Thank you\". For a moment I am filled with serenity and thoughts of the dawn's light, just like the day I received my staff.</p><p>Maggots are swarming all over. I step around them, casting a Healing Word on myself, and start toward the unconscious Kyrin. Shalkoc makes short work of the maggots with a fire breath, popping them like corn. Combat ends at last, and I rush over to Kyrin and get her back on her feet. Fearghas harvests the maggots, while telling Shalkoc to NOT eat them or even pick them up. He tries to get materials from the Deva's corpse, but it's too corrupted to make anything out of.</p><p>Kyrin finds 15 gleaming Springseeds. I scoop them up carefully and put them in my bag of herbs, hoping to plant them on Promise soon. We consider taking another rest, but the lair begins to quake and spasm. Again a rushing sound comes towards us from above. We cannot take another wave of bile now! I can confirm that we are in a stomach, urgh. The hole up north should be a throat of sorts; we dash into it, chased by the rushing sound becoming louder behind us. I block the tunnel with a Wall of Force as soon as we are through, but if the wall is unbreakable, the sticky walls of flesh will not hold much longer. We burst out of the sticky throat into a mouth with several rows of enormous teeth, closed.</p><p>Fearghas casts Shocking Grasp to get the creature to open its mouth, and his Lich Hand to tickle the uvula. It doesn't work out, so Emilio tries with a Mage Hand, but fails miserably. Kyrin stabs the tongue with her Psychic Blade. The blade goes in to the hilt, but we see no wound. The tongue rises to crush us against the roof of the mouth, but the teeth are cracking open. A wall of water rushes in…</p><p>Fearghas and Emilio very quickly put their heads together, talking quickly about magic. They come to the conclusion that teleportation should now be possible. Fearghas says \"Get in my mouth!\" and nobody understands until he polymorphs himself into a whale and takes a deep breath, filling his mouth with air. We all hop in.</p><p>\"I am the coo of the sea!\" Fearghas, 1497.</p><p>The water is a lot murkier, polluted with blood and bile. Whaleghas spots small Aboleths in the water. He swims up, and beaches himself on a… beach, and kindly opens his mouth to let us out. He reverts to his true form spitting, saying one of us tastes awful. Emilio apologises.</p><p>We are in a cave we've never seen before. Kyrin suggests a Detect Magic spell, so I take out my wand and give it a happy little wave. Kyrin seems to see just fine, she is intently looking around the cavern as if searching for something. We discuss our options; do we return to Fearghas' mansion in Ukgluz, or teleport to Promise? We quickly brief Kyrin on our… history with the Duergar. And the Drow of House Vandree… We decide to head back to Fearghas' mansion, on foot. Fearghas pops a spellgem of Find the Path.</p><p>We are on the other side of the lake, so it isn't far, but we have to go through the water again. Not a problem, as Fearghas turns back to Whaleghas to ferry us across. On the way, Kyrin says she was employed by the Drow to investigate Ukgluz, then tried to infiltrate Lessia with the Duergar, but she messed up, and can't be seen by them now. The last thing she remembers is Matron Vandree telling her she will never disappoint her again, and the next thing she knew she woke up in a gooey egg in the lair. The whale noises stop at that, then resume, and Whaleghas sneakily slaps Shalkoc with his tongue. Whalegas spits us all out on the other side of the lake, on the side of Ukgluz. The mutated larvae here have grown even larger…</p><p>Fearghas, back to dwarf form, grumbles about \"mahr-might taste\" again, and blames Shalkoc, who is offended. We make for Ukgluz, but Kyrin stops. She fears being recognised. Anxiously, she asks us not to tell on her as she shapeshifts into a child with the look of an urchin. Although she is smaller, her shadow grows larger. Irritatedly, she stomps on it and mutters at it under her breath. Her shadow behaves, and with child-Kyrin in tow, we walk to Ukgluz. Fearghas sticks the hat on his head and reminds us that we are all pretending to be his slaves.</p><p>As we reach the alleyway where the manor is, Fearghas stops abruptly. We all collide into him, which amuses a Duergar nearby, who asks how he will punish his slaves for this, and thankfully leaves. Right in front of the manor's invisible door is one of the Duergar's statues. Apparently these are the \"demon engines\" or are powered by them. It hasn't noticed us yet.</p><p>We investigate a little, then sneak past the statue. It doesn't move and we slip into the mansion unnoticed. Fearghas officially welcomes us to the Chateau de MacAllistar. We chill and get Kyrin up to speed about why we were in the Sibriex lair. Fearghas mentions, with no ill intentions I'm sure, that we went into the lair because I insisted on it. We nearly died in there… Suddenly choked with guilt, I excuse myself to the kitchen to make tea, but Kyrin thanks me for saving her, that if we hadn't gone into the lair, she would have been warped into a monster. I try to reply, but only squeak, and hurry to the kitchen, asking Shalkoc if we can make some cookies for everyone, too.</p><p>Fearghas, Emilio, and Kyrin discuss origins, reputation, and casual racism in the dining hall. We return with tea and snacks. Fearghas contacts Aviana with a Sending, asking where she and Plex are, and whether they are both safe. Aviana replies very tensely with \"where the fuck are you\", \"what is this bullshit\", and something about her dress being all dirty, and she was done with sewers, and she was done with filthy places! And this is more than 25 words for sure.</p>"

I ask if Fearghas can contact them telepathically, but that Discord call ended while I was forcefully offline thanks to Mind Blank.</p><p>We leave to look for our missing companions, but find instead a... Minor Malleable? With wings? Emilio and Fearghas blast it dead, we pick up 5 dreamfeathers and share them among us. There is a large black snake-like egg, with movement inside. Emilio punches it open and a petite woman comes out, a human who woke up from the worst nap ever.</p><p>We introduce ourselves and explain to her where she is. Her name is Kyrin and she has very little idea how she got here, poor soul. She gives healing potions to Emilio and me after seeing how beaten up we are, how nice! The potions that is, not the beating up part.</p><p>We return to the blood pool room and take a short rest in the bubble. There is a lot of healing to be done, Shalkoc cooks a big steak for Kyrin which prompts relentless questioning from Fearghas to ascertain the origin of the meat. Bless this dwarf. Kyrin's shadow seems odd, but I brush it off as imagination.</p><p>The celestial's voice encourages us to rest, and Emilio snaps at it. Fearghas offers him ale, for his nerves. Emilio refuses. Fearghas insists. Kyrin asks why he is so angry (Emilio, not Fearghas, understandable mistake dear reader). Emilio grumbles about his terrible luck. The celestial wants to teach me to heal better. Hard pass. I'm fine. Nuh-uh.</p><p>After some much needed R&amp;R, we jump down the maw in the middle of the room, and live thanks to Fearghas' Feather Fall spell. We end up in a large, disgusting, vaguely round cavern. No sign of the monsters we chucked into that hole last time, I'm sure that's nothing to worry about. Something is coming! Kyrin hides so well I can't see her at all. I panic and slip into my shadow. Fearghas quaffs some ale. Shalkoc casts a spell to make his muscles bigger. Emilio glares.</p><p>We're attacked? By a monster with FAR too many hands, claiming it just wants a hug. It has the celestial's voice, but the body is corrupted beyond recognition and twisted into a fiend. In spite of this, it kept its good intentions and keeps trying to help us, which turns into trying to kill us.</p><p>\"Aerelia if this thing is immune to paralyse, I'm going to shank you.\" Karnack, 2025.</p><p>It's a hard battle, the Perfected Deva always targets the lowest health character to \"help\" them, and it grapples like a son of a kobold too. It teleports, inflicts fear, and generally hits like a truck. Kyrin flips it off as a free action. I'm grappled within an inch of my life and I realise that under the creature's skin, maggots are teeming. If they could teem a bit more, we could get interesting results. Speaking from experience.</p><p>We hatch a plan. Emilio and Fearghas ready their spells to hit the Deva on my turn and force it to use its legendary resistance. I put myself in a box, that is Wall of Force, because I am at 1 HP and my Death Ward triggered. Kyrin goes down despite some sick dodges, but all is in readiness. I drop concentration on Wall of Force, take off my spellwards, and channel for all I'm worth.</p><p>I CAST HEAL AT 9TH LEVEL!</p><p>According to plan, the maggots multiply and the boss explodes! It thanks me in a last whisper just before Shalkoc grills all the maggots with a dragon breath. Do not eat the maggots. I rush to help Kyrin but it's too soon to celebrate, as another wave of bile is coming for us. We run into the only exit, a sticky tunnel that I block with a Wall of Force. This only buys us a little time, as the flood of bile is so bad, the throat-like tunnel will give out before my spell does. We exit the tunnel into a huge mouth with several rows of teeth, firmly shut.</p><p>We think on how to escape, but soon Fearghas says \"Get in my mouth!\"</p><p>Nobody knows what he is talking about. (except Emilio for meta reasons)</p><p>He polymorphs into a sperm whale.</p><p>Everybody knows what he is talking about.</p><p>Shalkoc gets slapped by a tongue, one of us tastes like Marmite, we are carried to freedom by the glorious form of Whaleghas.</p><p>\"I am the coo of the sea!\" Fearghas 1497.</p><p>After learning Kyrin is a changeling, we decide to return to the Chateau de MacAllistar in Ukgluz. We dodge a statue that was staring at the door, thankfully without consequences (right?), get in, chat over tea and cookies, and send a Message spell to Aviana, with a response that is mostly grumbling about her dress being all dirty.</p>"

          "name": "76.1 - The darkness below",
          "section": "journal-pages",
          "content": "<p>The magical darkness drifted away as though possessed by a mind of its own. Naami breathed a sigh of relief, but the emotion was short-lived. Looking outside Fearghas' protective bubble, she recognised nothing in the shuddering flesh walls; not a landmark nor a previously explored tunnel. Her hands trembled in spite of her efforts to stay calm. There could be no escape from here, not without killing the demon. She ran her fingertips on her spellwards, longing to remove them to invite the torrent of power that would crash into her mind. How she would love to end it. Not likely; she was a healer after all and not much of a combatant. But... her thoughts chased one another in dizzying circles. Celestials. Her spellwards. The Staff of Power. Blood and darkness. The light of dawn, and death in her hands.</p><p>\"Naami, come here,\" Fearghas said, interrupting her uncomfortable daze.</p><p>He was sitting quite close in fact, and simply pulled a gem from his bag. It was a beautiful diamond, which the wizard mercilessly crushed in his fist to activate the spell within. He smeared the dust on Naami's forehead with a hand covered in writing calluses.</p><p>\"There. This will protect you from mind reading and other unpleasant mental spells.\"</p><p>Naami murmured her thanks, just as she realised her head was suddenly quiet. Confused, she looked around questioningly.</p><p>\"Ah, yes,\" Fearghas added. \"Forgot to mention, that also excludes you from the telepathic bond.\"</p><p>\"It's fine,\" she said. \"We're sticking together anyway. Nobody wanders off on their own.\"</p><p>The last came with a pointed look at Plex, who was skimming a spellbook filled with tiny illustrations. The goblin ignored it; most likely he had not noticed the reproach was targeted at him. The healer's disapproval shifted to Shalkoc, who was muttering and tinkering with utensils and ingredients. How was he <em>cooking</em>? Here of all places? With a grin, the Dragonborn straightened and craned his neck to look at Aviana. He handed her a large bowl that seemed a thimble in the giant harpy's talons.</p><p>\"Energy soup,\" he said proudly. \"Fix you right up! I made something for Naami too.\"</p><p>A plate of small round cookies was thrust into Naami's hands as Shalkoc gave her a winning smile and an invitation to eat up. The plate was warm; a thin curl of steam rose from the cookies. How had he just baked treats? Naami took one, and nearly dropped it in shock.</p><p>\"They're meat cookies,\" Shalkoc chuckled. \"Full of tasty energy!\"</p><p>Naami's stomach lurched. She tried to look away from the fleshy walls, but it was impossible. The ground and ceiling shivered too, occasionally oozing blood or dripping sizzling acid. Groans and gurgles drifted from the floors and ceilings, all too reminiscent of a tortured stomach. The whole place reeked of rotting flesh and the heavy, sickening metallic smell of blood. She thought if the party made it out alive, she might never want to eat meat again. Or to eat at all.</p><p>\"Don't be shy,\" Shalkoc said. \"It's protein!\"</p><p>Shalkoc's cooking had always been excellent. Naami held a cookie in a trembling grip and closed her eyes to shut out the revolting surroundings, only to open them again. It was worse without seeing. It was so much worse. Silencing her thoughts, placing all her trust into her friend, she took a bite. What looked like cookies were more akin to ground meat patties, seared just right and lightly spiced. Savoury warmth and a chewy texture gave her newfound strength, as even the ache of bruises and scrapes faded away. She surprised herself by taking a second cookie, and a third, reconsidering and discarding vegetarianism. Shalkoc beamed when she handed him a cleaned plate.</p><p>\"You got <em>meat</em>? No fair,\" Aviana pouted as she sipped the last of her soup.</p><p>Despite her pouting, the harpy looked better as well. She flexed her talons gingerly, then with more force. When she stretched her legs she gave a wince; it was gone in a flash, but Naami had noticed. Reaching into her dwindling supplies, she pulled out a sizeable piece of nirca root and handed it to Aviana.</p><p>\"Here, if you eat this for dessert, it should help your legs.\"</p><p>The dark root near disappeared into Aviana's hand. She popped it into her mouth, chewing experimentally.</p><p>\"Hey, no more pain! Thank you Naami, you are truly the only one in this party who cares to heal me.\"</p><p>\"T-that's not true!\" The halfling protested, just as Shalkoc exclaimed \"I'm always cooking for you!\"</p><p>\"Now now children,\" Fearghas interrupted in an amused grumble. \"If we're all fixed up, we should get ready to leave. The bubble won't last much longer.\"</p><p>Emilio, back to his usual form, gave a short nod. Plex waved at Naami from the ground.</p><p>\"Pick me up!\" The goblin squeaked. \"I'll ride on your shoulder!\"</p><p>Naami obliged, though it was somewhat unsettling. Plex began to argue in her ear that it made sense, with her being able to see through the darkness. Tactical advantage, the need for reasonably-sized people to stick together in a world of knees, the whole tirade. She listened distractedly, wondering why her and not Emilio, who could see through the horrible shining darkness without having to cast a spell. One glance at the warlock answered her question. His white hair seemed to ripple in the absence of a breeze, and his pink eyes shifted so the irises seemed to blur. His slender body was tense with focus. His bandaged fingers curled around nothing as if eager to transform into claws again, or to cast one of his destructive spells. Ally. He was in control of his powers. He would remain in control, and she was <em>not</em> trying to convince herself of it.</p><p>It was time to leave. Fearghas passed through the bubble first, dispelling the magic. The party picked a corridor at random, and walked down the narrow tunnel in uneasy silence. Soon, they were face to face with a wall writhing with cramps. Emilio shook his head and turned around, his jaw tight. It was a shorter walk back the way they had come, and they only found another wall. Shalkoc leapt aside with a yelp; on the ground, a small hollow had opened up and was continuing to expand, filling with dark blood. The foul liquid sizzled and Shalkoc examined the hole that had been burnt through his boot.</p><p>\"Are you hurt?\" Naami said.</p><p>\"No,\" the Dragonborn said after a short hesitation. \"I was too quick for it.\"</p><p>His enthusiasm sounded forced. The pool's edges crept up and apart, threatening every foot in the vicinity. When it seemed like the only option was to buy time by climbing up, one of the walls groaned and ripped open in a sickening squelch. Fearghas gagged and cleared his throat. Emilio paled, swallowing convulsively. Before Naami could treat their nausea, black tendrils rushed towards the party, darting out of another cloud of magical darkness which engulfed them all.</p><p>\"There's something up ahead,\" Emilio said. \"Something big. And the wall... the wall... blinked? Ugh... a lake of blood ahead, and something snake-like inside. Arms and legs in the lake, waste below the surface. Are we in a stomach?\"</p><p>\"It's not a real creature,\" Naami said, unable to keep her voice steady. \"We're not inside a giant animal. It's all a product of filthy magic.\"</p><p>Emilio responded by raising a bandaged hand and firing crackling energy through the dark cloud, producing wet impact sounds and a twisted howl. With a white-knuckled grip on her staff, Naami wove threads of magic and settled them on her eyes. The blinding shine of the dark cloud dimmed, the foul mist lifting. She wished she could use the same spell on Plex, who was blindly gripping a strand of her hair, but she had never managed to make it work on someone else. Emilio sensed the magic and directed a joyless smile to Naami.</p><p>\"Now I'm not the only one cursed with knowledge,\" he said coldly.</p><p>\"Ah, make way, Lord of Ultimate Darkness,\" Aviana said, ducking her head to fit in the narrow tunnel. \"I want that snake thing.\"</p><p>Her talons wrapped almost tenderly around an item Naami had learnt to fear; the dented iron flask the harpy treasured.</p><p>\"This thing is empty, right?\" Naami said.</p><p>\"Of course! Shalkoc put me in it just recently. An unglamorous experience.\" Her mouth twisted at the memory.</p><p>\"I was there,\" Naami said impatiently. \"But you were whisked off to the Feywild after that while strangling Plex. Last time that happened, you came back with an ancient fey in the flask that nearly killed Emilio.\"</p><p>Aviana waved the comment away. \"It's empty, for now.\"</p><p>The greedy look in her eyes made it clear she did not intend for the flask to remain empty. Not much reassured, Naami looked down just in time to see a misshapen monster rear towards her. Twisting bowels, too many for one creature and most jutting out of others, made up a serpentine mass that tilted back before spewing acid at her. Naami threw herself to the side, her stomach cramping. A yell in her ear told her she had failed to protect Plex.</p><p>\"It's in my eyes! I can't see a thing!\"</p><p>The tiny goblin wiped his eyes frantically; soon enough, Emilio suffered the same fate.</p><p>\"Oh for the love of... Naami, where are they? Guide me!\" Fearghas muttered from behind the others.</p><p>She tried her best to describe the situation to him, pointing and tugging strands of magic for him to sense. As he spoke a spell, she realised in panic he meant to hit her. Before she could dodge, a bolt of crackling lightning sped past her, lifting her hair, and blasted three of the monsters in the cavern, killing one. The corpse of a mangled humanoid crumpled and slipped into the bloody lake, the scarred skin sizzling as the acidic liquid attacked it.</p><p>\"That lake is acid too,\" Naami cried.</p><p>As if on cue, a fleshy limb thrust out of the darkness and squeezed around Shalkoc, dragging him into the lake.</p><p>\"Help!\" He yelled as the acid touched his scales.</p><p>His screams were silenced by a heavy thud as he grappled and fought with a mass of flesh and organs, much like the abomination that Emilio had blasted earlier.</p><p>\"The walls,\" the warlock groaned, clutching his head. \"The walls... moving... Danger... Have to... get close!\"</p><p>He had taken several blows, Naami realised, some of them acid burns spreading on his skin. Aside from the physical injuries, a fevered glint glowed in his eyes. True to his words, the walls shifted and heaved, tripping him and Naami alike. Plex tumbled from her shoulder screaming.</p><p>\"Get close!\" Emilio growled.</p><p>He twisted around and pointed at Fearghas, shooting three purplish beams at him. The dwarf dropped to his knees cursing, dodging the spell.</p><p>\"Emilio, what in the world?\" Fearghas called, struggling to his feet.</p><p>With a cry of pain ending in a triumphant shout, the warlock whipped his head around.</p><p>\"It took over my mind for a minute; that eye in the wall did. I broke the spell. Sorry for aiming at you. I only wanted... I wasn't in my right mind.\"</p><p>\"No harm done, lad,\" the dwarf said, unconvinced. \"Oh watch out!\"</p><p>Emilio spun around only to be hit in the face with another splash of acid. His hands went to his eyes as he made an inhuman sound deep in his throat, pain and fury tangled as one. Naami reached out to him; he was too far to touch, but close enough to hear. She used her voice to carry the spell, infusing a single word with positive energy. She felt some of his wounds closing, some of the pain receding, but the magic escaped her control. It leapt, resonating, strands chasing one another and weaving chaotic patterns, only to unravel and snap into place. Plex, who had finally wiped the acid from his eyes, tugged at the hem of Naami's dress.</p><p>\"Why'd you throw me off? I can't see a thing again! Pick me up!\"</p><p>Too distracted to pick up the wizard, Naami watched in horror what the magic had wrought. Another cloud of seething darkness surrounded her, emanating from her. It was not her own magic, but it had sprung into existence because of it. One of the wild magic surges plaguing the world, it *had* to be magical darkness of all things... She fought the urge to laugh at the irony, knowing it would sink into a mad cackle. The magic did not even stop at that. Instead of dying down, it surged even stronger, this time wrapping around her body. Powerless to stop it, she felt shuddering magic touch her skin and melt into it. Immediately her eyes watered, and she was wracked with one sneeze after the next.</p><p>Plex, who was climbing back on his perch, had to hold for dear life as the poor healer sneezed uncontrollably. When the goblin finally made it up, gripping a fistful of Naami's hair, he confirmed her suspicions.</p><p>\"You're allergic to something,\" he muttered, out of breath from his climbing ordeal. \"Something really common, like wood or metal.\"</p><p>\"Cloth,\" she cried. \"I can't just take off my dress!\"</p><p>\"I would not recommend it,\" the goblin said pragmatically, and pressed a hand to Naami's cheek. \"Now, tell me where the monsters are!\"</p><p>She guided him verbally between sneezes, and he replied with the pressure of his fingers to confirm her instructions. When he was pointing straight at the monsters, and also Aviana who was pummelling the mass of flesh to make it release Shalkoc, she murmured \"fire\". Plex seemed to take offense to this, and unleashed a blizzard onto enemies and friends alike. Aviana dodged with a squawk, but Shalkoc had no such luck as he was still held by the monster. He yelped in the cold, then screamed as he was being squeezed. Too soon, his screams dwindled into gasps as the strength was leaving him.</p><p>\"Plex can't keep shooting blindly!\" Naami cried, feeling so much worse for her part in it.</p><p>\"Calm down, lass,\" Fearghas said, cracking a spellgem in his fist.</p><p>The darkness around Naami dissipated, eliciting a shout of delight from Plex. Relieved, she thanked the dwarf, who only grumbled and settled a pair of ornate glasses on his nose.</p><p>\"Shalkoc!\" Aviana shouted.</p><p>His friend's voice gave him new strength; the Dragonborn's eyes blazed and he let out a roar that belonged on a much larger creature than him. Aviana paid it no mind, and sank her talons into the monster.</p><p>\"You are being rescued,\" she said. \"Do not resist.\"</p><p>With a powerful flex of her legs and wings, she leapt into the air. Shalkoc was dragged along yelping with increasing dread as they fell back down and crashed in an explosion of lighting from Aviana's cursed footwraps. Shalkoc slumped in the grasp of the fleshy horror, stunned for a moment, but came to his senses when an eye bulging out of the nearby wall grabbed hold of magic and spread a stain of darkness around itself, swallowing the two friends in gloom.</p><p>\"Enough of this!\" Emilio growled as he changed, eyes growing dark, his claws bursting out of the bandages.</p><p>Free from the restraints of his \"disguise\", he threw himself forward and into the area frozen over by Plex' blizzard. Slipping and stumbling, he managed three blasts of force on his way, then rushed towards another monstrous lump of flesh. There were two, Naami realised, one who was squeezing the life out of Shalkoc and the other falling prey to Emilio's slashing claws. Plex tugged Naami's hair, getting a yelp for his trouble.</p><p>\"I can't see over there,\" he snapped. \"This way?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" she stammered. \"Two big ones. More to the left! You'll hit Aviana and Shalkoc. Now, here!\"</p><p>The goblin grinned as he uttered words of power, words that made Naami's hair stand on end. The magic shifted, flows twining and braiding into cords that lashed at reality, tied knots into it and *pulled*. A rift opened, not in the ground but in the air, slamming invisible weight on the monsters. It lasted only a moment, leaving Shalkoc and Aviana unharmed, but the fleshy abominations were squashed by overwhelming force, muscle ripping, organs tumbling down into the sizzling lake. Shalkoc twisted out of the grapple at last, crying for help even as he inflicted draconic punishment on the enemy.</p><p>\"Fade, help us!\" Naami cried.</p><p>Shadows gathered in front of her, coalescing into the feline form of her umbral spirit. Silently, Fade lifted her head then sprinted to the closest enemy, her fangs finding warped flesh and blood underneath. Naami started towards Shalkoc, her heart cold with worry at the Dragonborn's weakening cries. Struggling to keep her footing on the spasming floor, she got her first good look at her friend since the fight had begun. A breath of stale, reeking air caught in her throat; Shalkoc's scales were torn around deep gashes, he was covered in acid burns and wings had sprouted from his back, his last shield against the blows raining upon him. He could only defend himself, breathing in short gasps that spoke of broken ribs. His shoulders sagged, his legs trembled, and he looked ready to collapse.</p><p>Naami raised her arms, her spellwards catching a feeble red glow. She would not look away from her friend, would not blink, as if her gaze alone could keep him on his feet, grant him strength to stand long enough to be healed. She wove her spell, urging more strength into it, feeding it her life force. The magic resisted her efforts, refused her offering of blood. She did not stop to wonder why; Shalkoc's injuries were too severe. Naami released her spell with a flash of regret, knowing she could make it stronger if only it would obey her! As the restorative energy sank into her friend's body and mended the cracked bones, she knew. Her spellwards were protecting her. The cool metal on her skin, her father's hands on her wrists, keeping her from drawing such power that would consume her.</p><p>\"Dad,\" she sobbed. \"Thank you for watching over me. But I'm a big girl now.\"</p><p>\"What are you talking about?\" Plex said into her ear. \"No time for sentimentality! We fight! Get closer, let me at them!\"</p><p>The goblin bared his teeth in a snarl. Naami feared he might forget about magic altogether and simply bite holes into anything that came his way. She hoped her neck would not enter his calculations. Sickening tearing sounds told her that Emilio had found something to slash at. He was helped by Fade who jumped in and out of invisibility, appearing long enough to deliver an iron bite.</p><p>\"Out with you,\" Aviana muttered, pulling the cursing eye out of the wall.</p><p>The eyestalk stretched, producing a shriek despite the absence of mouth, then snapped with a wet crack. She held up her trophy, one talon piercing the eyeball that dripped bloody jelly down her arm. She looked a hero with her giant size and triumphant pose, and at last the battle was ending as Emilio reduced a slithering mass of guts into a pile of gore, and Shalkoc delivered a final blow to one of the large abominations. The last one remained, bloodied appendages slamming down in a frenzy.</p><p>\"Oh let's end this,\" Fearghas snapped. \"Aviana, trust me?\"</p><p>\"Wha... of course!\"</p><p>The harpy flashed a winning smile and a thumbs up, displaying the eye impaled on her talon. Fearghas heaved a sigh, then muttered a spell. Naami watched magic twist in his grasp; there was a darkness to it. She wanted to look away but made herself watch as the dark magic flied to Aviana, ripping gashes into her raised arm. She cried out as her blood gathered in mid-air, cradled by Fearghas' magic. It twisted, then crystallised into crimson spikes; in the blink of an eye, they plunged into the monster and tore it from where it stood. The sheer force of the magic drove the abomination to the far wall of the cavern, nailing it to the vertical surface.</p><p>\"Hey! The walls are helping us!\" The harpy said happily, ignoring her new wounds.</p><p>The far wall twisted next to the staked monster, ripping open into a mouth devoid of lips, possessing two rows of chipped teeth.</p><p>\"No, we're not.\" The wall said, then the mouth spat frothing pink blood and closed, leaving a frayed line.</p><p>\"Fearghas?\" Naami squeaked. \"What <em>was</em> that?\"</p><p>\"A spell,\" he said absentmindedly. \"Nothing to write home about. Shalkoc, look here, in that pool.\"</p><p>Naami shivered. Nothing to write home about? Half of Bottleneck would have a fit if they heard about that spell. There was dark magic, and there was this. There was necromancy to stray close to the veil between this life and the next, only to be used to delay and deny death, or in self-defence to call death under threat to a witch's life. Those spells were not evil in nature, but as any magic or weapons, they became evil when used for evil ends.</p><p>This was blood magic, and all it could do was harm allies and enemies alike.</p><p>She looked at her friend differently then, and saw a darkness in his eyes, close below his usual grumpy but caring demeanour. There was greed, a bottomless pit of hunger as if the dwarf yearned with all his soul for something he would not speak of. In the hellscape of a powerful demon's lair that had been havoc on her nerves since she realised what it was, she knew chilling fear. The nightmarish cavern lurched around her and she stumbled, losing her footing. Searing pain attacked her legs when she splashed into the pool of acidic blood. Fighting the urge to vomit, she clambered up on the fleshy mass that jutted out of the pool, forming an island of sorts. Feeling her way up, she grabbed a bulbous growth that burst under her fingers. With a scream of disgust, she tumbled back and would have landed into the acid if not for Emilio's assistance. He offered a claw for her to grab on, his black eyes emotionless. She grabbed at his wrist to not slice her fingers on the razor-sharp claws, allowing him to pull her to safety. Shaking, Naami tried to catch her breath when a gentle voice spoke in her mind.</p><p>\"How beautiful! Lending a helping hand really shows the good in you, the very essence of Nirvana.\"</p><p>The celestial's voice. Naami's mind snapped back to another cavern, ripping a sob from her throat. If she could only find them. This time, she knew better. She could heal them. She could save them. Atone. It would never wash the blood from her hands, from her soul, but maybe there would be fewer nightmares. Maybe she could sleep a night and not wake up screaming, seeing her hands covered in bloody entrails and maggots. Maybe there was hope this time.</p><p>\"I'm scared,\" she said truthfully. \"Where are you?\"</p><p>She was hoping for an answer from the celestial, for any help in finding them, but her hopes were soon dashed.</p><p>\"Shut up!\" Emilio snarled next to her.</p><p>The voice answered neither. Could its owner even hear them?</p><p>\"Hate to interrupt the voices in your heads,\" Plex said, \"but there is stuff in there.\"</p><p>Naami turned her attention to the blood pool the goblin was pointing at. Scrubbing tears from her cheeks, she saw that both wizards had summoned spectral hands to search the acid.</p><p>Fearghas whistled. \"There's a small fortune in there. How's that hoard of yours looking, Shalkoc?\"</p><p>The Dragonborn beamed. \"Can always use a top-up.\"</p><p>\"Other things,\" Plex said, scooping up bits and pieces with his disembodied hand. \"Scraps of fabric, from clothes? Yes, clothes... poor quality, pretty much rags. Chains. Broken items. Something over there that isn't dissolved yet.\"</p><p>\"Same chains the Duergar put on their slaves in Ukgluz,\" Fearghas said darkly.</p><p>It all but confirmed Naami's theory; the Sibriex was not here by chance. Despite the damply warm air, she shivered. Slaves' chains in the lair. Null-Steel chains. Demon engines. King Dimzad's mentions of binding demons. Were the Duergar sending slaves to the Sibriex as payment? As material? All the twisted monsters they had slaughtered... The misplaced organs she recognised, from learning how to heal their injuries and illnesses... She found herself pressing her spellwards onto her skin, leaving marks on her wrists.</p><p>The stain on her bracelet.</p><p>The sooty Null-Steel chains.</p><p><em>Two large wings nailed to the ceiling by thick metal rods, only one still attached to their back. A once beautiful face forced to one side, roughly sewn to the shoulder from temple to jawline, the stitches infected and swollen. The right eye gone, replaced by a growth akin to a hornet's hive.</em></p><p>Naami ground her teeth against the scream building up in her throat. She could not... not now... not again... Focus! She made herself look at her companions and name them one by one. They needed her. She needed them. She could not lose herself to terror again. Fear would paralyse her, and lead her to the wrong choices.</p><p><em>Magic surged through her, for a second chasing away everything but the cleanest awe. Such power as she had only known in the most desperate situations, and without doubt this was one of them. She guided a flood of positive energy towards the ruined body in front of her. Power to close mortal wounds. Power to cure unknown plagues. Power to turn souls away from Pharasma's call. Eyes of pure light looked down on her, pity turning to fear. Then to sadness.</em></p><p>She wished she could scream now. She barely breathed. Her friends. Need. It had to end. She clutched her spellwards. Ildilas, surrounded by chaos. Mum, Dad. Even if they survived this, could she ever return home? Would the nightmares ever end?</p><p>End the fear.</p><p>Her friends' voices began to reach her, first in short bits, a word or two. Then she caught sentences. Shaking, Naami focused on the words, applying all of her willpower to listening and understanding. Fearghas repeated several times to Aviana that she was resistant to acid. Aviana protested, asking why she should be diving in. Emilio talked about time, and Shalkoc was rambling about numbers. A splash as the harpy dove in, excruciating wait, and she resurfaced holding valuables.</p><p>\"A gold chain, a locket - also gold! And a robe. Shame it's not a dress, the embroidery would really compliment my wings.\"</p><p>\"There is no way you're putting on a robe this size,\" Fearghas said in tones of long suffering.</p><p>\"Why I never! Are you calling me <em>fat</em>!?\" The harpy choked.</p><p>The dwarf rubbed his temples. \"You're tall even without a potion of giant size. How exactly would you get your wings through this robe anyways?\"</p><p>\"Well, you know... I can have it modified for me!\"</p><p>\"Quicker to have a new one tailored for you. And it's hardly the time or the place for this kind of conversation!\"</p><p>\"He's right,\" Emilio said. \"The longer we stay here, the more danger we are in.\"</p><p>\"But there is so much money in there!\" Shalkoc complained with a longing look to the pool of sizzling acid blood.</p><p>\"We do not have time,\" Fearghas said, emphasizing each word.</p><p>\"But my hoard?\"</p><p>\"No. Treasure is useless to the dead.\"</p><p>Realising that pleading would get him nowhere, Shalkoc gave a small sob. Aviana had handed the gold chain to Emilio at his request; the young man was gazing at the flawless fire opal set in it, oblivious to his surroundings. It was a beautiful stone, shades of orange giving the illusion of a flame frozen in time. His lips moved silently, his fingers just short of touching the smooth ornament.</p><p>\"Come on everyone, let's continue,\" Fearghas said briskly.</p><p>With a start, the warlock tucked the piece of jewellery away. Aviana stuffed the robe and the locket into her pack. Shalkoc was the last to leave, reluctantly. The party picked a tunnel at random; there was no way to orient in the maze of foul corridors and even had there been landmarks, they would not stay in place. Naami followed, legs trembling and thoughts skittering. She kept her eyes down, focusing on her footing on the treacherous ground but that did not help her shut out the sounds. Groaning and rumbling told of spasming walls, which the ground also reflected. The noise increased until it was constant, forcing her to look up and ahead. Suddenly, her companions' half-heard concerns made too much sense. The walls ahead were closing in, near closing the narrow tunnel shut.</p><p>\"I don't think we are running from that,\" Plex said pragmatically.</p><p>\"We could stand and endure it,\" Aviana said with a flex of her muscles.</p><p>\"And hope the tunnel opens up again?\" Emilio said, voice full of doubt.</p><p>\"That, or let ourselves be squeezed and pushed along,\" Fearghas said.</p><p>\"I say we stand our ground,\" the harpy said.</p><p>As the party argued and the spasms came closer, Naami's mind grasped for an elusive piece of half-remembered information. The sounds filled her perception; what was it they reminded her of? Time was growing short. She had to remember. She could all but feel the pain in those cramps. Did this place... creature... thing... feel pain? Then it hit her.</p><p>\"If we stand our ground we'll die!\" She exclaimed.</p><p>The party looked at her questioningly.</p><p>\"The way those walls move, it's like intestinal cramps,\" she said disgustedly. \"These are severe, they can last several minutes. We'll be crushed.\"</p><p>\"Not if I have a say on it,\" the dwarf said.</p><p>The closing walls were almost upon them. Fearghas took out a gem and smashed it; the now-familiar dome of force sprung into existence, just big enough to shield them all. And just in time. The fleshy walls squeezed on top of the group, pressing down on the transparent bubble. On all sides, diseased flesh and muscle twitched and clenched, burying the bubble in oozing tissue. Nobody spoke, watching, trusting the dome would hold. Tortured sounds filled the air, making Naami want to clutch her stomach. She had helped people suffering this kind of cramps, people who writhed on their beds. The toughest patients had howled with pain as disease ravaged their insides. She had despaired then, when her herbs had brought only minimal relief. She despaired now, when all light was swallowed by the moving walls. The world shrank to a pinprick of poisonous air smothered by flesh held at bay by a thin sheet of magic. Her head spun. If they survived this...</p><p>Would she ever see home again?</p><p>Her fingers twitched with a memory of magic that turned into the urge to channel. Healing. If only she could heal the source of this madness. What happened if she healed a demon? How would an embodiment of chaos and destruction react to a force of pure good? Although... healing magic was not good, was it? It could hurt. Heavens have mercy on her soul, it could kill. Would it be evil to kill the Sibriex? She knew the answer without dwelling on it. Naami had only ever killed when there was no choice, when it was her life or the enemy's. Except for that one time. The demon needed to die, and if she could, she would kill it.</p><p>With a shock, the halfling realised she was cowering next to Aviana and murmuring breathlessly \"Kill it, kill it, kill it.\". It required an effort to stop. The harpy looked down and beamed at her, giving her the thumbs up. Her talons were still bloody from piercing the eyeball. Naami's head spun; for a moment she did not know who she was. Did Aviana take this seriously? Did Shalkoc? Fearghas' earlier outburst made more sense with each passing moment. They <em>had</em> to stick together no matter what. The healer's hands shook; she blinked away the vision of blood and maggots. Killing the cause of such corruption and torture could not be an evil act.</p><p>Seconds trickled past, pooling into minutes. Naami shivered when she realised she had been right. It took all her willpower to stop herself from shaking. She had been right, and Fearghas had had a spell to deal with it. All would be well. They would live. She fought the urge to crouch; the ceiling was so close. She could not imagine how Aviana must feel; she had to bend her considerable knees. The harpy did not look anxious, and Naami could not decide whether it calmed her, or terrified her more. After what seemed like hours, the walls relaxed and expanded again, with slow reluctance as if there was a will at work, a creature that had tried to smother them. There probably was, at that. Or maybe this had just been the work of twisted magic and tortured flesh. Naami decided she did not want to know.</p><p>\"Do you guys hear this?\" Aviana said.</p><p>The tunnel was open, if not exactly wide, and Fearghas had dispelled the bubble. Another cloud of twisting darkness loomed just ahead, hurting Naami's eyes.</p><p>\"Hear what?\" Shalkoc said.</p><p>\"Trickling,\" the harpy said. \"Like water? It's getting louder.\"</p><p>There was no water in this warped place. Before she even heard the rushing of liquid coming closer, Naami knew.</p><p><em>Her wounds still ached under the fresh bandages, burns and scrapes, a few nasty bruises. Nothing too serious, unlike some of the Drow. She had patched them up as best she could, but some of those injuries needed a closer look and time to heal. Real rest. Naami was setting priorities in her mind when one of Lady Vandree's consorts shouted a warning. The walls quivered, then shook, then convulsed. The Drow drove their swords deep into the walls and Naami imitated them, pushing her dagger to its hilt in the repulsive wall. Just in time; a surge of reeking bile flooded the tunnel. Naami clutched her dagger in a death grip, but it was not her fingers that failed. The blade was made to her small hands, its bite not deep enough so it was torn from the wall before she could scream. The acid burnt her skin; she shut her eyes in terror, unable to breathe as she was dragged away by the corrosive torrent. She slammed into walls and tried to get her feet under her, only to get turned upside down. She could not breathe. She could not...</em></p><p>\"No!\" She screamed.</p><p>Her fear roared into sight, a wall of yellow-green liquid speckled with black and red; seething, diseased bile. Her hand went to her dagger, and fell to her side. It had not worked last time; why would it now? What could she —</p><p>The flood hit her full force, and she only managed to squeeze her eyes shut. In a second it had passed, leaving her trembling and stinging but otherwise unharmed. A yelp behind her made her spin around and she saw Fearghas and Emilio swept away. The dwarf was pushed onto a bend in the wall, where he grabbed hold of a jutting flap and held tight until he could stand again. The warlock had no such luck and was dragged screaming into the darkness. The world tilted around Naami, her vision going dark.</p><p><em>Pain returned first, heavy limbs and scathed skin. Then Naami realised the burning in her lungs was gone, and so was the sickening liquid that had submerged her. She could breathe again! Relieved, she took a deep breath, only to gag on a stench of rotting flesh and unspeakable things. Coughing and retching, she fought the nausea with all her might. Then she heard it, another sound filling the reeking space. She froze, stomach turning and eyes scanning the darkness, to no avail. It was unnatural, nothing like the gentle twilight or the mystery of deepest night. This darkness shone brighter than the midday sun, hurting her eyes and turning her blood to ice. It was... corrupted. Suffocating. Perverted. Twisted. EVIL.</em></p><p>Naami screamed herself out of her waking nightmare, calling out to Emilio. He did not answer but she had no way of knowing if he was already too far, or if he <em>could</em> not shout. What if he was unconscious? What if he had been swept far away, to a cavern filled with corruption and torture?</p><p>\"Emilio!\" She shrieked in terror.</p><p>Her chest hurt as if stabbed, yearning for the telepathic bond that would let her feel what her companions felt. It would hurt, but she would know. Being left to wonder and speculate... She thought having an arm torn off would not be a lot worse.</p><p>\"He's hurting,\" Plex said on her shoulder. \"He's been swept away and into a hole in the floor. A hole with teeth. Barely caught himself on one.\"</p><p>Of course, the others still had the bond! Cursing herself for not realising sooner, Naami asked details from the tiny wizard. She grimaced when he said Emilio's burns were severe, and more so when Plex mentioned an enemy close to Emilio. She had to get to him! Sharing her sentiment, Shalkoc dashed ahead, stumbling through the darkness. Naami reached out for her magic, for a simple spell to pierce the darkness. She had to make two attempts before she could weave the magic to suit her; the strands seemed to slip and escape her. She could not calm her mind. She had to find Emilio and heal him. If she could ride Fade... but she could only keep her in the world a short while, and her time was up unless she resummoned the spirit. No. She needed her magic to heal Emilio.</p><p>\"Naami, I must offer my thanks for carrying me,\" Plex said with no prompting whatsoever.</p><p>\"This is really not the time,\" she stammered.</p><p>\"There is time while we walk. By we, I mean you. But here, a small token.\"</p><p>The goblin rummaged into his bag and handed her two minuscule bottles. As she took them and the magic affecting Plex lost its hold, the bottles grew to their normal size. It appeared to be wine, thick and dark so it was nearly black. Naami slipped them into her bag, ignoring the thoughts of bottled blood that had sprung up in her mind. Remembering Plex' insistence to uphold the balance of trade, she offered a torch in exchange; it would not help him see through the magical darkness, but she hoped the symbolism would count for something.</p><p>\"Good year,\" Plex said as he sipped some of the syrupy wine.</p><p>How many bottles had he been carrying? Naami started in the direction Emilio had disappeared, through the cloud of magical darkness. It didn't hurt her eyes as badly now, and she could see through it, but her skin pebbled with discomfort at the thought of the corrupted magic touching her. Frightened fancies, she reprimanded herself. She prepared to weave magic into a pattern of healing, anticipating finding Emilio. If she could just get close...</p><p>Plex' magic intruded in her concentration. He was preparing an offensive spell, his demeanour more collected than Naami thought possible in this place. A sound just ahead gave the goblin the excuse he was waiting for and he released his spell, booming thunder and crackling lightning erupting in the darkness. It hit a monster, breaking its invisibility and knocking it to the ground but instead of dissipating, the magic lingered in a wide circle around Plex. Throat closing with dread, Naami cast out her magic sense. Another surge? The magic swelled like waves, an ocean just out of sight. It rumbled, an earthquake that did not touch the earth but shook the air and hummed in complex, ever-changing patterns. It howled like a silent wind, imperceptible to those lacking the gift but undeniable in its presence. It seized reality itself, making Naami's head spin. Plex went very still, in awe or excitement she could not tell. Tides of energy leapt about, a force driving the world, a fleeting sensation of wild colours and roiling chaos.</p><p>And light was no more.</p><p>Naami blinked, feeling for her darkness-piercing spell. It was still here; she sensed her magic on her eyes, but she could not see shapes nor light. A wall of complete blackness surrounded her on all sides no matter how she spun around. It did not hurt her eyes like magic-wrought darkness. It had nothing of the night, or the absence of light in a deep cavern. She was not being shielded from the light. There was no light.</p><p>She was blind.</p><p>She heard herself scream, a cry of uncontrolled despair, uncontrollable terror. Mentally she clawed at the magic that surrounded her, suffocated her. She could not see the strands of magic to cast a spell! She sensed the force of the wild magic on her and it was implacable, merciless in its strength. She had felt magic this powerful a couple times; she had cast the like herself, but only ever for healing. This was a curse with the strength to level a mountain range, or alter the flow of time. Her knees went weak, all sensation draining from her legs. She only remained standing thanks to Plex yelling in her ear.</p><p>\"What's going on?\" The goblin asked. \"Get close! We need to help them!\"</p><p>\"I can't,\" she said, her voice distant in her ears. \"I'm blind.\"</p><p>\"You're not serious?\"</p><p>She sobbed, unable to repeat the words. Plex shouted a direction and she stumbled forward, feet numb, her eyes uselessly open as wide as they would go. The voices of her companions started to drift to her from up ahead. A bend in the tunnel? Her hands shook, she was too terrified to even reach for the walls. Anything could come out of <em>that</em> and bite her, or grab her. She would have no warning.</p><p>\"Please leave me alone,\" an unfamiliar voice cried. \"Please I've been tortured so much. All my scales have been ripped out to make a cloak. Don't make me go back there. I don't want to go back in there!\"</p><p>Then a groan, a cry, and a sound ominously reminiscent of Shalkoc's dragon breath, except Naami was sure it was not him. This sounded deeply wrong, a breath that tore out of a scorched throat.</p><p>\"I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!\" The voice cried again, rougher than before and ending abruptly.</p><p>\"Emilio's down!\" Fearghas shouted.</p><p>\"Oh this is stupid,\" Aviana growled.</p><p>She had been guarding the rear, and now stomped towards the voices. There was a horrible tearing sound, wet like rotten cloth ripping. The smell of blood and decay, always present here, became so much sharper. A stomach-turning squelch, more ripping, and Aviana stomped away.</p><p>\"W-where are you going?\" Naami sobbed. \"Don't leave me alone.\"</p><p>\"You're not alone,\" Plex said. \"Aviana broke through that wall. Over there! I'll guide you now.\"</p><p>How the fates had shifted, Naami thought, a tiny spark of irony in the terror threatening to consume her.</p><p>\"Put Emilio in the flask!\" Fearghas' voice. \"He's not from this world right?\"</p><p>\"I'm pretty sure that will not work,\" Aviana said.</p><p>\"I'll save him!\" Shalkoc said.</p><p>Naami strained her ears, until the darkness in her eyes faded to the background. She heard weak coughing and choking, then Fearghas' incredulous voice.</p><p>\"Did you feed him <em>snot</em>?\"</p><p>\"Ah!\" Plex chimed in. \"The Bagiennik's snot! Excellent for healing injuries.\"</p><p>\"That's... real?\" Naami asked.</p><p>Plex launched into a passionate description of the frog-like Bagiennik, growing very graphic on the topic of the abundant produce from their noses. A fascinating subject certainly, but Naami cared more for Emilio's condition. She heard gasping and gagging, then a voice unmistakably Emilio's, hoarse and feeble.</p><p>\"Thank you...\"</p><p>Relief flooded her mind and body. She steeled herself and followed Plex' directions, drawing her sharp dagger. She needed to see to make magic work, so the dagger would have to do if she was attacked.</p><p>\"Naami! Shalkoc and Emilio are badly hurt!\"</p><p>Fearghas' voice again. \"I'm blind!\" She shouted back. \"It's a surge. Can't cast anything!\"</p><p>\"I will personally obliterate the Feywild. I'm sending them to you!\"</p><p>Before Naami could ask what the wizard meant by \"sending\", she felt a tug in the weave of magic and heard her friends yelp in surprise, then Plex giggled.</p><p>\"He opened a dimension door, and chucked them through it with his spooky magic hand,\" the goblin said.</p><p>Naami felt around her, praying to find her friends and not some disgusting piece of unidentifiable organic material. Her fingers brushed against Shalkoc's rough scales, and then Emilio's smooth cloak. Acting on instinct alone, she spun a web of restorative energy and pushed it towards them both, letting the positive force sink into their battered bodies. This close, she sensed their pain as her own, the agony of countless burns knotting their muscles into iron-hard tangles. Emilio was breathing heavily, swaying on his feet. Naami feared he would fall, but instead he transformed. With a deep growl, he assumed his void form and snapped his teeth shut as if he had bitten through something.</p><p>\"There's one of the explode-y fellows,\" Shalkoc said in a strained voice. \"The acid will splash all of us.\"</p><p>\"Protect Naami. I'll kill it.\" A barely-human snarl from Emilio before he leapt to the attack.</p><p>Naami's heart froze. Her healing spell had barely done a thing, unfocused as she was fighting the panic born of her blindness. Did Emilio not feel pain? Did he not realise how serious his injuries were? He had been very near death a minute ago and he was jumping right back into the fray! Naami carefully avoided the obvious question, that of his sanity, which of course only made doubt loom larger in her mind. She promised to herself if they survived this nightmare, she would dose him with a brew so bitter he would think twice before rushing into danger. Oh, she knew what herbs to boil for this!</p><p>\"Don't make me go there again! I don't want to go, not again please! I don't want any more mercy from <em>that thing</em>!\"</p><p>The unfamiliar voice again, the last of his screams drowning into liquid sounds.</p><p>\"Dragonflesh golem,\" Shalkoc said through gritted teeth. \"So corrupted... part of that was a dragon, once. This is mercy.\"</p><p>Naami nodded, her stomach lurching. The creature's screams still rang in her ears, too near the screaming in her mind. Not again. Aviana roared in fury, a sound followed by a heavy thud and distorted shrieks. Another splash suggested this monster had suffered the same fate as the golem.</p><p>\"Fearghas is using his... axe?\" Plex said, horrified. For a wizard to be fighting with a weapon! \"Hey Fearghas! Would you want to buy my potion of haste?\"</p><p>Dwarven curses, then Fearghas retorted in a biting tone: \"Plex, do you understand the concept of <em>dying</em>? This is no time to be trading! If you have a potion, fork it over!\"</p><p>This apparently insulted Plex. With a sniff, the goblin used another of his infamous short-range teleportation spells. His weight gone from her shoulder sent Naami into panic. She called out, her voice shattering. Not again!</p><p>\"I'm right here!\" Plex squeaked, thankfully close by. \"Take this!\"</p><p>The ground quaked with one of Plex' gravity-altering spells. Monstrous shouts told Naami it had found its mark, but celebration was short-lived. There was a cry for Emilio to watch out, and the warlock's own shout was cut off.</p><p>\"What happened to him?\" Naami cried.</p><p>\"Eaten,\" Shalkoc said, defending against more attacks.</p><p>\"The acid will kill him!\"</p><p>\"Don't worry Emilio!\" Plex interjected convincingly. \"Stomach walls are not really walls. They are in fact creature parts, tissue if you will, so it makes sense that they don't block your vision! If you think on it, you can see even in there!\"</p><p>Clearly it was enough to convince Emilio. In a sickening cacophony of slashing, slopping, and ripping sounds, the warlock clawed his way out of the creature that had swallowed him. A burst of acid hit Naami and Shalkoc; he merely grunted, but Naami was too slow to dodge. Acid gnawed at her arms and legs, making her howl in pain. She half-collapsed against Shalkoc and pushed herself off him to not hinder his movements. Her thoughts... would not work anymore. Magic? There was only burning.</p><p>\"I am so <em>done</em> with this place,\" Emilio growled, panting with pain.</p><p>\"You and me both,\" Fearghas grumbled.</p><p>An explosion, a hiss, and silence descended on the party. Naami stood paralysed, sobbing and shaking. She did not hear Fearghas until he was right in front of her.</p><p>\"Don't move now,\" he said.</p><p>In a rustle of paper and an incantation, he ended the relentless itching from Naami's cloth allergy. Realising how bad it had been, she let out a shuddering breath. The crack of a spellgem, and her sight returned. She squinted in the sudden light, met with a horrifying landscape of blood draining through a maw in the ground and on the far shore of the emptying pool, an altar covered in strewn tools. The horror of the torturer's workbench was nothing next to her sight returning. She could have hugged Fearghas had she not been covered in acid.</p><p>\"I could not see any of you,\" she cried. \"I was so scared... so scared you would die...\"</p><p>\"We're all alive,\" the dwarf said gruffly. \"Bad wounds, but we can take a moment to fix them up. We're going to have to. Something bad is waiting for us below.\"</p><p>Naami peered down the maw at the centre of the room but she was too far to see anything else than a hole descending into darkness. From the hole drifted a voice, the same she had heard in her mind so many times. Except this time it was not in her thoughts.</p><p>\"Welcome.\"</p><p>A warm, earnest invitation. She swallowed hard. The celestial was down in the place that had made the golem scream; the place Emilio nearly fell into.</p><p>\"We need a moment,\" she said faintly.</p><p>Nobody argued. She set to patching up Emilio's injuries; most were severe burns and he winced when she treated them. He did not cry out or protest, which somehow made her sad. Fearghas handed out healing potions while Aviana carefully scouted the room, bringing back items she found by the altar. When she brought back a heavy skin-bound tome, Fearghas' eyes lit up with the same hungry glint Naami had seen before. It lasted only a moment as he examined the tome, muttering arcane terms under his breath.</p><p>\"Emilio should have the cloak,\" Shalkoc said. \"I can defend in Turtle Stance, but his style is all-out attack.\"</p><p>The Dragonborn handed over a black cloak made of overlapping scales. In Naami's mind, a twisted cried echoed; _All my scales have been ripped out to make a cloak._ She tried and failed to push it out of her mind. It didn't matter, she told herself. If Emilio was better protected, then he should have it. It was mercy on that poor soul; it had been far too corrupted for saving.</p><p>She worked in silence, avoiding the middle of the room as she treated her friends' injuries and her own. Fearghas put up his protective bubble once more.</p><p>\"About that haste potion?\" Plex began, then swallowed the rest of his sentence under Fearghas' withering glare.</p><p>\"I'll trade you for it,\" Emilio said.</p><p>He reached into his pack, grimacing as the motion pulled on his wounds. Gingerly, he pulled out a small wooden figurine.</p><p>\"My chicken!\" The goblin screamed, half disbelieving and half delighted.</p><p>Emilio held the carved bird out of Plex' reach, which was easy considering his diminutive size, though somewhat pointless if he decided to teleport.</p><p>\"The chicken for the potion,\" he said.</p><p>Plex accepted immediately, handing out the potion to accept the last survivor of his chickens. Emilio handed the potion to Aviana.</p><p>\"We'll need you in the front line,\" he said. \"Don't want anything in exchange.\"</p><p>The harpy accepted and slipped the potion into a belt pouch, in easy reach. Amid the carnage of corpses and acid, on the shore of the drained blood pool, the party settled to gather their strength for the upcoming battle. This one would decide their fate.</p>"

          "name": "77 - Cookies and threats",
          "section": "journal-pages",
          "content": "<p>While the rest of us are safe in the Chateau de MacAllistar sipping tea and eating cookies, Aviana and Plex are still in the Sibriex lair, fighting for their lives. They do a very respectable amount of ripping and tearing until it's done, and find loot equal to 1700 gold (850gp each). Their resources all but spent, they are attacked by a giant ooze that… promptly dies by melting away as it moves, flooding the entire hall in blood and bile and other disgusting things. (This is when Aviana gets Fearghas' message spell, as she was waist-high in that ichor with Plex on her shoulder.)</p><p>They get to one closed butthole and ponder how to get out. Aviana ponders tearing it a new one, literally, but decides against it and tries to pry open the existing one. It does not work out, as she is too grossed out, and attempts to use Plex as a towel to avoid touching it. Plex is at 8 HP. He has some ideas, none of them good. He settles on Prestidigitation, which triggers an irrelevant minor surge, to clean up Aviana so she doesn't use him as a towel. Plex hands Aviana a slice of cloth cut from a tent, from the time we first met Emilio.</p><p>Plex casts Pulse Wave to force the butthole open. They exit the lair into pitch-black water. Below them is a mountain of waste from the lair; some things within are shimmering. There are 3 pyropes and 3 jades, which Plex grabs with his mage hand. Because of the earlier surge that teleported Fearghas to the Plane of Water, both Aviana and Plex know where Fearghas is, and they know where his manor is. Plex casts a Dimension Door to the surface, but Aviana doesn't fit through it, not just because she is too big but also because Plex is too small (he is still tiny).</p><p>Aviana grabs Plex, who chugs snot to survive her Vice Grip. This circumvents the issue with Dimension Door, and they teleport to the surface. Plex would 100% have died without the snot. They swim ashore; they know where to go, but must be sneaky about it to not be taken for runaway slaves by the Duergar again. They are immediately spotted by two Duergar who call out to them.</p><p>Plex stands on Aviana's shoulder and says hello, which confuses the Duergar because they can't see the tiny Plex. He says he wants to get into Ukgluz to meet a friend. The Duergar demand to know what they were doing, and who owns them. Plex guesses he is owned by Mannon, who is not there at the moment. The Duergar call for reinforcments. Plex requests to be grabbed by Aviana again, and casts Vortex Warp at 4th level on himself to teleport into Ukgluz.</p><p>This of course attracts a lot of attention and soon 15 guards are running after them. Plex panics, casts Fey Step and teleports 20ft to the East. Fearghas' Plex-sense is tingling; he gets a splitting headache out of nowhere, sends a Message to Aviana, who screams in answer. Fearghas gets The Look (tm) on his face as he says Plex and Aviana are running amok in the city, and he needs to go and get them. We all go out to look for our… friends.</p><p>We soon hear a commotion three streets over, of a now-normal-size harpy running like Jack Sparrow shouting \"What did I do? Stop chasing me!\". She runs into a market stall, prompting more screaming that guides Fearghas and the rest of us towards them. Plex pockets a piece of cloth, Aviana runs into soot and her face is now black. She spots Fearghas dashing towards her with The Look (tm) on his face. Aviana is chased by 20 guards shouting to stop these runaway slaves. Plex teleports him and Aviana a short distance.</p><p>Fearghas says \"play along\" and cracks both of them on the head with his staff, shouting at them. I try to stop the violence, to no avail. Emilio nods like this is the most reasonable thing. Fearghas apologises to the Duergar and makes a good show of a repentant master. The Duergar are visibly losing brain cells, and say that they will have to report this and Fearghas is to show up at the court house by tomorrow for the report.</p><p>The Duergar insists that Fearghas puts his slaves in chains, so Aviana says she brought her own chain and pulls out a regular chain, a pair of manacles, and finally the Null-Steel chain. Fearghas chains Aviana up with the regular chain, and Plex with the Null-Steel chain, and we head back into the manor the moment the guards have their backs turned. Fearghas hesitates to unchain Plex, who is very confused about the Duergar (he has never met them directly). Fearghas explains. Plex is confused as to who Fearghas can't be the slave.</p><p>Aviana is stuck in the steel chain and calls Fearghas for help. Kyrin meets Aviana for the first time as her face is black with soot. Fearghas cleans her up with Prestidigitation, and makes the introductions with Kyrin. I hand Aviana a cookie and gain inspiration, yay!. Kyrin is happily munching away on more treats, looking like a child with chocolate smudged on her nose.</p><p>Aviana wants to open a cookie business because she thinks Kyrin is adorable. I remind her that we are now in legal trouble with the Duergar, and we are summoned to Hell within the week, not to mention we are planning an ambush on Matron Vandree. We also need to retrieve the Eye of Dahak from the Drow to help the king of Lessia before we can go back to fulfilling our contracts with Hell. Kyrin says she knows where the Drow are. Or… were. She's not sure how long she was in the egg. She describes the place where the Drow where, a place I recognise. We both grimace as we speak about Matron Vandree.</p><p>Aviana grumbles very much about how Fearghas' manor looks, and that it needs a complete makeover. We argue there are more pressing matters, i.e. resting because we are all beaten up. Fearghas gives me a triggered spellgem of Private Sanctum. To release the spell, I need to say Execute in Dwarven. Kyrin pulls out an ink-black piece of cloth and slaps it down on the floor, then climbs down into it. It's a Portable Hole! She suggests using it to sneak out of the city, which will cause issues with bags of holding, but this is something we are aware of (thankfully).</p><p>Kyrin takes the appearance of Aviana, at her urging. Aviana is star-struck and has her try on a silk robe, and a dress. Fearghas sighs and disappears into the cellar with the intention to drink himself silly. The servants bring a comfortable little pad for Emilio and put it in a corner, as if he was a grumpy little cat; surprisingly he is sitting at the table and having cookies with the rest of us. <s>Emolio</s></p><p>I use my last spell slot, and channel to heighten it from level 5 to level 8, and cast Remove Curse on Plex. He can speak again without music playing in the background, and he is again of reasonable size.</p><p>We take a long rest. I HAVE HP AGAIN.</p><p>(Now the new rest rules come into effect; the next long rest we can take is on Saturday.)</p><p>We are having breakfast the next day and discussing our plans when Matron Vandree speaks into my mind:</p><div><p>Naami. My little traitor.</p></div><div><p>Did you think your disloyalty would go unnoticed?</p></div><div><p>A little bird, fluttering through King Dimzad’s halls, sang me such a lovely song.</p></div><div><p>It spoke of a stolen sceptre, a clever little plan... and you. The bait. Squirming so prettily in the jaws of a trap meant for me.</p></div><div><p>But fret not, little one. That shall not be your fate.</p></div><div><p>No - yours will be a special one.</p></div><p>For you will soon learn what fate awaits those foolish enough to betray me - and anyone they've ever held dear.</p><p>Shaking, I repeat these words to the party. She will hurt Madr. Emilio and Kyrin comfort me, and Fearghas promises we will take care of it. Aviana suggests making Matron Vandree disappears. We say that is the idea, and nothing short of it will free Kyrin and me from her influence.</p><p>Shalkoc cooks up a feast for us, in which he eagerly takes part. Plex and Aviana give 1 pyrope and 2 jades to Fearghas. Kyrin gives me a potion of greater healing. Fearghas cooks up some potions, but the alchemy goes awry.</p><p>We have to exile Shalkoc to the other end of the manor to drink tea, ale, and potions, as all liquids still turn to lukewarm water when he is within 60 feet.</p><p>Plex turns himself and Aviana tiny so they can sneak better. Emilio scoops up Aviana and hides her in his breast pocket. I lift Plex, scold him, and gently place him in my bag with instructions to not disturb my herbs! Fearghas casts Rary's Telepathic Bond, which I am again excluded from, my mind is still blank... We leave the mansion. Fearghas is tracking mud everywhere for a week because of a surge. I offer to cast Remove Curse on him, but he advises me not to spend this many resources.</p><p>We head to the market as I need to replenish my healer's supplies. Fearghas buys me 2 healer's kits, and I sneakily hand him the money when we are out of sight. Fearghas then buys alchemical supplies. Aviana bullies him into buying her a new mug, which grants her inspiration as it is useless.</p><p>We head to the king's hall to speak to Dimzad. Kyrin, who transformed into a Duergar, so she stays outside to \"watch over the slaves\", that is the rest of us, while Fearghas goes in to speak with the king. Kyrin grumbles at this, she wanted to investigate the hall for something hidden, or someone disguised. Fearghas solves her concern by using a See Invisibility gem.</p><p>One of the seats to the king's right is empty; last time, a priest was sitting there. The king greets him by saying \"Out of your portal, are you?\". Fearghas says the Matron is aware of the ambush, and that she has a spy in Dimzad's court. He furrows his brows at this, says he suspected something as some scrying sensors were recently found, one of those at the entrance of Fearghas' portal. (I assume he means the door to the manor.) The sensors were destroyed (presumably this is why an armour was at the door?), but Dimzad says the plans have changed, and asks Fearghas what he is planning to do.</p><p>Fearghas says he assumes the Matron will come get me, and also he plans to investigate a camping location of the Drows'. Dimzad asks why he should let the Halfling (me) go. Fearghas says that I am in his employ and care. Dimzad asks why he should let either of us go, as us surface-dwellers don't know how to use Null-Steel…</p><p>Fearghas warns us telepathically, and the hall's doors begin to close! Fearghas teleports back to us with a Dimension Door cast with a Subtle Mind Crystal to escape being taken prisoner. The plan is now to run. The moment we start running, statues (demon engines) advance towards us, carrying black nets of Null-Steel.</p><p>Aviana hops out of Emilio's pocket and chugs a Potion of Giant Size. Plex drops concentration on the spell that made him tiny, and casts Adjust Density on Aviana to halve her density and increase her jump distance. She uses Legendary Vigor to further increase it. Fearghas casts Feather Fall on us so we don't straight up die.</p><p>Aviana scoops us all up and jumps 700 meters up and forward, to not bonk her head on the ceiling (close call). Kyrin and me point to the Drows' camping site as we are gliding through the air; the campsite is empty, and we float far past it. We end up about 3km from the city gates. Aviana approaches the ground and we wriggle out of her grasp to avoid being caught in the explosion from the Thunderfeet Footwraps. All of us jump and float down before she lands, but Emilio is too fancy for this and uses his Robe of Stars to disappear from this reality and reappear a short moment later.</p><p>Aviana gently floats down, triggering an explosion, but she takes the superhero landing pose. It looks very different when she isn't slamming down into the ground, but she is having a great time. Plex missed the landing a bit, and emerges from underneath a large mushroom cap somehow. Aviana stomps over to us, Fearghas asks if everyone is alive, and Emilio wants to fly again. Adrenalin junkie…</p><p>We agree to return to the campsite to look for clues. It's uncomfortably close to Ukgluz, but needs must. Emilio gives a heartfelt compliment to Fearghas on his excellent use of Dimension Door; he feels invigorated. Aviana carries Emilio up on her shoulder to repay the favour of him carrying her in his pocket earlier. He is loving the height.</p><p>We get to the campside, and from Ukgluz we see several demon engines coming in our general direction. We decide to hide nearby and wait for the searching to die down. Aviana puts us all in a potato sack and climbs up to a ledge where we hole up in a cavern that is big enough even for her in giant mode. As we arrive in the cavern, a lage lizard slithers away, deciding it isn't messing with something the size of Aviana. Kyrin scouts further into the cavern, finding only large lizard eggs. Shalkoc gets a hungry look in his eyes and sneaks off towards the eggs until we grab him by the scruff of the neck.</p><p>We sit down to keep watch; around 30 demon engines are roaming the area, and after around 3 hours they start to head back towards Ukgluz. After 6 hours, they are all gone. In the meantime, Fearghas looks for herbs and finds some Shimmerleaf, which he coaxes to grow with magic from a gem. I help him out with herbs as he starts brewing. Aviana inspires him to do his best by flexing. He brews up 1 Potion of Supreme Healing. Kyrin takes out a notepad and starts sketching the area, adding some notes. Kyrin conjures up a Mage Hand to pick a blue flower she spotted. She picks two, gives me one which I put in my hair, and presses the other into a book, which gives her inspiration!</p><p>Plex summons a Mage Hand to… fight Kyrin's Mage Hand? He only gets a moderate surge that restrains him for a day. The Mage Hand backfired and is now holding him very tight. Aviana wants to chain him up to carry him like a bag. Or tie him up with a hempen rope. Or a jungle vine, whatever he prefers. He can't struggle anyway, and is fine being carried around, but he would much prefer if Fearghas carried him around on Tenser's Floating Disk for a day. Fearghas grumbles, but Plex argues he owes him a favour. Fearghas casts Tenser's Floating Disk and Aviana places Plex on it. She spins the disk.</p><p>We climb down with Aviana's help and approach the camp; Aviana stays on the ledge as she is too noticeable, and could easily jump to us in an emergency. There isn't much here, and footprints make it clear that this place has been searched by the Duergar. Fearghas casts Detect Magic. I wave my wand to do the same. We see remains of divination magic, and high-level conjuration magic… that's traces of a Plane Shift spell!</p><p>\"Fearghas, where did you park Plex?\" Aerelia.</p><p>Plex was parked next to the remains of the campfire; staring into the ashes, he spots bones… weird bones he's never seen before, they're a little transparent with an iridescent shimmer. He picks them up with his Mage Hand. The bones used to belong to a magical creature, it still holds faint conjuration magic. Plex licks the bones, it tastes surprisingly fishy, a lot like his Fishy Magic.</p><p>Wait… I've eaten this fish before, on my travels with the Drow. At a time when we were travelling through deeper levels and food was scarce, the Matron left saying she would get food from the castle, Plane Shifted away, and returned with a barrel full of these fish. When I asked which waters she got these from, she chuckled and said \"there is no water there, they just float\".</p><p>I describe the fish I remember, and Fearghas conjures up an illusion, both of us working out an accurate image of the creature. None of us knows what this is. Shalkoc tries to eat the illusion. I mention the Drow having a place in the Shadowfell where they would stay, which makes Plex do a big frown. Kyrin gives the camp a last good look and spots an elusive little emblem of two crossed daggers. It's made of a mate metal that doesn't reflect light; I immediately recognise the crest of House Vandree. Assassins who worked for House Vandree wore this in the centre of their chest. Thin leather straps lie next to it, one of them stained with blood. I suggest a scrying spell.</p><p>We return to where Aviana was waiting, but on the way, Fearghas and me are spotted by the lookouts on the walls of Ukgluz… the gates open and 12 demon engines charge towards us! Aviana bids goodbye to the lizard mum who she was having a deep conversation with, and jumps down to help us.</p><p>Fearghas shouts \"Hop on!\" and polymorphs into a giant dinosaur bird! (Quetzalcoatlus) We get on Quetzalcoatlhus MacAllistar, Aviana wonders if her wings would look like this if she didn't have any feathers, what a sad thought. Emilio is happily sitting on the dinosaur, aura farming. We get away, land, and Fearghas drops Polymorph to cast… Plane Shift?! Where are we going?</p><p>We appear in a tower in a demiplane. Fearghas says it belonged to another wizard, who seems to have passed on and, in scientific terms, \"he called dibs\". We climb the stairs to a room which floor tiles are carved with letters and numbers, and the edges of the room are littered with bones. Fearghas warns us to not go into that room alone. We climb up to the library, a room that makes Fearghas very happy. He starts researching the fish. Another room in the library holds an empty altar and glowing runes that look similar to the ones on the Void Explorer's Spellbook that Fearghas pulled out in the Sibriex lair, which caused Emilio to lose control… Fearghas says the room is no longer trapped, and Kyrin walks in there unharmed. Fearghas, Plex, and me research the golden fish. Plex has to cast Comprehend Languages to read any of the books because he does not know how to read.</p><p>Aviana and Emilio were left behind on the floor we arrived in. Emilio is anxious, doesn't feel safe. Aviana encourages him to follow the rest of us, but she is too big to fit through the staircase, so he goes alone. Into the room with the letters. The one we should never be alone in. He climbs up the stairs, and ends up… at the bottom of the stairs, unable to leave the room. Fearghas gets a Skype notification in his head that someone intruded into the tower. He goes to get Emilio, getting him unstuck. Emilio joins us in the library… and immediately sees the purplish runes on the floor of the other room. His gauntlets react even at this distance. He asks Fearghas why he has void runes in the tower, he replies they came with the tower when he took over.</p><p>Emilio is not feeling good because of the runes, I offer help but he brushes me off roughly. Fearghas hands me the \"Note to Future Self\" they previously found in the tower. I read it with great fascination, and eventually Fearghas finds information on the fish! It's a space guppy, native to the Astral Plane. Led by Fearghas, we climb up to the Greenhouse. I am fascinated by everything, and lag behind a bit. When I join the rest of the party on the floor above, it's very overgrown and there is a giant dead plant. Fearghas mentions having to fight it.</p><p>Another floor up is a room-wide device that can enhance magic items. It's crazy messy in there, so I tease Fearghas about it. Above is the Observatory, a room where the floor looks like a star chart and most of the space is taken up by a massive telescope. Fearghas instructs me on how to use it, and I hop on the chair and look for Ildilas. It doesn't look so different from when I left it… except it waves like a mirage, only Ildilas, like something is distorting the image. The desert in the centre of the island… maybe has expanded? It's hard to tell, the image is so distorted, and I've only seen maps a few times. The coastline is the same, but the sea just off the island seems shallower, lighter in colour, like the sea floor is raised, in a pattern reminiscent of tree roots jutting from a stump. It faintly reminds me of something I read once, or heard from an elderly relative. Ley lines? I can't recall…</p><p>We try to search the Astral Plane for a castle but it's a needle in a haystack situation. That being said… we do have time. Fearghas summons an Unseen Servant to clean up the tower so he doesn't have to do it himself. Wizards… I ask Fearghas if we are safe in the tower, if the Matron can come get me here. He's pretty sure she could not, or at least it would be as tough as it's going to get for her!</p><p>We suggest spending some time in the tower to research:</p><ul><li><p>Matron Vandree, on the off chance we find anything</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The Astral Plane and a castle with space guppies</p></li><li><p>Dragon aspects, their eyes, effects on mortal races, dragon sickness</p></li><li><p>Ley lines</p></li><li><p>Duergar religion and scepters</p></li></ul><p>I also said I wanted to examine everyone, with their permission, because we sustained severe wounds in the recent fights, and I want to make sure we're all okay before we get into another battle.</p>"

          "content": "<p>The nightmare was different this time. As Naami slipped into a fitful sleep in one of the tower's cosy guest rooms, she expected to find herself in the cavern again, defenceless before her fear. She stood in darkness but it was the natural gloom of a deep cave instead of the painful magic-wrought darkness. It was similar to one of the caverns she had traversed with Matron Vandree's party; a high roof made a dome above her head, pierced with stalactites like giant teeth ready to bite down. A dark moss carpeted the rock and a wild array of mushrooms grew close to the walls, fed by dripping water. A purple fungus grew halfway to the roof, its stalks tough as wood. To one of these trunks, the dark shape of a male Drow was nailed by his wrists. His body hung limp as he struggled to breathe, growing weaker by the second.</p>\n<p>\"Madr!\" Naami cried and reached out to her friend.</p>\n<p>His eyes glittered with hate. Blood trickled from his mouth.</p>\n<p>\"Traitor,\" he spat. \"Did we not take care of you? Protect you? You <em>had</em> to run to your kin of cowering surface-dwellers!\"</p>\n<p>\"I was all but a slave,\" she cried. \"I said I would free you. I can save you, too!\"</p>\n<p>She tried to get close to him but chains wrapped around her neck, and around her bare wrists. The sooty links were driven into the ground, anchored as solidly as if they had grown out of the rock. She struggled, but the cold metal only bit into her skin. Above her Madr's body convulsed, blood flowing out of his mouth now. His eyes closed as his face contorted with pain. Against her better judgement, Naami tried to raise her hands, tried to form the pattern in the Weave that would heal him. She could see the magic, although dimly. The chains dragged her down, draining her strength. If she could manage just one spell, she could save him. Screaming in frustration, fighting her shackles, she called the magic with all her might. It had always been here, an unseen force that would crash into her mind if she so much as thought of it. It would not deny her now! The cold radiated up from her wrists to her shoulders; her fingers went numb. The chain strangled her, now she too was fighting for air but Naami was no stranger to battles anymore. She tasted blood but her spell was taking shape, just another thread of magic and she could release it, seek out Madr's wounds and close them. She could save him. She could save everyone.</p>\n<p>The Drow cried out as white wings burst from his back, wide and brilliant in the gloom. His face was no longer his, the sharpness of his features smoothed into a celestial's perfect beauty. Eyes of pure light gazed down on her, filled with worry and pain.</p>\n<p>\"I can help you, little candle,\" the winged man said in a caressing tone. \"I can teach you to become a better healer.\"</p>\n<p>\"No!\" Naami shrieked.</p>\n<p>Her tenuous control over magic slipped and she released her spell. Knowing what would happen did not make it any easier. The celestial had worn Madr's face just a minute ago, but his body flashed into a tortured ruin, a mockery of what an angel had been. The spell closed mortal wounds, only for the skin to burst a moment later, spilling blood, torn entrails, and maggots. Held by her chains, Naami could only scream and writhe as her hands were splashed with blood, as squirming shapes climbed up her legs. Slicing through her screams a voice reached her, cold as a poison-coated blade.</p>\n<p>\"Traitor,\" Matron Vandree said, her silhouette looming in the shadows. \"You have chosen your fate, and the spider goddess has blessed me with the duty to deliver you onto it.\"</p>\n<p>\"I healed your people!\" Naami cried. \"I offered my blood and my life force to close your wounds!\"</p>\n<p>\"Only to plot to kill us all,\" she laughed, a joyless sound more akin to that of a blade being drawn. \"How pointless. Is it the same with your surface-dweller <em>friends</em>? Do you also heal them, only for them to run back into the fight and get injured again? Why do you try? Why do you pay the cost in blood, time and again, for nothing to change?\"</p>\n<p>\"Because that's who I am.\" Naami could not blame the chain around her neck for the pain in her throat, the stabbing heat of a lump announcing tears.</p>\n<p>\"Useless,\" the Matron sneered. \"All you do is undone. Give up. After betraying me, there is nothing left for you anyway.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're wrong!\"</p>\n<p>She smiled; it was a threat. \"Why don't you scream how wrong I am? But will anyone hear you?\"</p>\n<p>Naami's resolve flared; on the edge of delivering a biting response she saw the Matron lift her arm, fingers hooking around threads of magic. She uttered words of such power, Naami's bones hummed with it. Then all went black, vision and hearing swallowed by humid warmth and the overpowering stench of decay. Before she even touched the inner shell of a slimy egg, before her flesh began to spasm and change, she knew where she was; back in the Sibriex' lair, being warped into a monster, and she would not have Kyrin's luck. She screamed then, screamed until her throat was raw and her head spun, screamed until the darkness seized her and she slumped inside the black egg, her skin bulging in agony. She howled, and there was nobody to hear her.</p>\n<p>Naami screamed herself awake and twisted out of the sweat-soaked sheets, brutally landing on the rug next to her bed. She lay on her back, eyes darting as she tried to catch her breath. The reek of blood and decay lingered in her nose; her fingertips still felt slimy. She grabbed at her throat, and could not stifle a relieved sob when she found no chain there. Her spellwards were snug on her wrists, a familiar coolness on her clammy skin. She drank in the quiet of the tower. She was safe here, was she not?</p>\n<p>A bang at her door made her jump near out of her skin. She lay in the dimness, panting as quietly as she could, unable to move for her life. She listened with all her being but after a short moment, a familiar voice spoke.</p>\n<p>\"Naami? You're awake?\"</p>\n<p>It was Aviana's voice. Naami tried to stand twice but her legs would not let her. She had to settle for slumping on the rug, draped in her blanket.</p>\n<p>\"Yes. Um… Sorry if I woke you?\"</p>\n<p>\"It's alright. Are you okay? I heard a noise.\"</p>\n<p>Naami gathered her courage for a confident reply. She would give a little giggle and dismiss it as a dream and the harpy would laugh, maybe tease her, and be on her way. It would be as if none of this had happened. All she had to do was wave a hand and smile. She would climb back into bed, and go back to sleep.</p>\n<p>\"I had a nightmare,\" Naami said in a tiny voice, barely swallowing a sob.</p>\n<p>A pause, then: \"Can I come in?\"</p>\n<p>Naami gave a squeak in assent. The door swung open, admitting the harpy. Aviana sat on the rug next to her, her dark wings making the small room feel crowded. Naami reached out to brush the feathers, her hands shaking. In the darkness she could not see where the dark grey feathers turned to deep blue, but it was enough to know they were not white. Her stomach turned at the memory of brilliant white wings. How much longer would she suffer those nightmares? She had overcome her fear! She had defeated the monster in the Sibriex' lair!</p>\n<p>With a lot of care, Aviana put one hand on Naami's head, her sharp talons curling away. The Halfling gave a surprised start, but at the first clumsy head pat the tension began to drain from her shoulders. Aviana's careful touch made her skin tingle; the friendly gesture, if awkward, was immensely calming. She realised her jaw ached from grinding her teeth, and made herself stop.</p>\n<p>\"The bravest of us have nightmares,\" Aviana said wisely. \"Sometimes even when we are awake. Often, they're called Plex.\"</p>\n<p>The Halfling giggled in spite of herself. Oh, she was still shaky, still haunted by the horrifying visions. But Aviana's words… they were real. Her friend was real, and they would protect each other.</p>\n<p>\"And sometimes, even Plex disappears,\" the harpy went on. \"So nothing is so scary it lasts forever! Until Plex comes back, I suppose… Better to focus on the good things. I've only ever seen you in the green dress, do you have a blue one? Deep blue, like my feathers, that would <em>really</em> compliment your eyes, and it would go well with the bracelets you always wear.\"</p>\n<p>\"I do have another travelling dress,\" Naami said, her voice becoming steadier. \"It's more of a light blue, though.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well that will hardly do,\" Aviana sniffed, dead serious. \"We <em>do</em> need to go shopping some time. I also need another mug.\"</p>\n<p>\"Didn't Fearghas just buy you a mug?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" she admitted, patiently drawing out the word, \"but he bought it from the <em>Duergar</em>. Who knows how it was made. Probably by slaves. How unethical! It will make my drinks taste of low morality. And then my skin will get all dull. You need to pay attention to these things.\"</p>\n<p>Tears rose to Naami's eyes faster than she could stifle them. She was blubbering before she had a chance to calm herself. Hearing Aviana's usual talk, as if nightmares had no power on her, on the world… the sense of relief was just too powerful for her shredded nerves. She wiped her eyes, only bringing out more tears. She grieved for the celestials, she feared for Madr and for her friends, but above all she relished Aviana's lively presence, she delighted in being alive and well herself. Angels or demons would not break her. She had powerful allies she could rely on, and they were becoming dear friends too. Neither the Drow nor the Duergar would stop her. She would find out what was happening in Ildilas, and she would go home and see her parents. She could introduce them to her friends!</p>\n<p>\"There, Naamilia. It's okay,\" Aviana said, her usually flamboyant voice dropped to a soothing whisper.</p>\n<p>She draped one wing over Naami's shoulders. Silky feathers brushed the Halfling's skin, a cool caress and an occasional tickle. How had Aviana come up with this nickname? It didn't matter. Naami reached out for a hug, her hands growing steadier. Aviana hugged her back with great care, as if she was made of brittle glass. To the harpy's strength, she probably was even more fragile than glass. Beneath skin unmarred by scars, thanks to potions and magic, Aviana's muscles were steel. Even as she sat with her legs casually crossed, comforting a friend, she had the aura of a force of nature. She was a rock, steadfast and immovable, unlike the boulders she liked to move. There was no place safer than Aviana's arms in this moment.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you,\" the healer said.</p>\n<p>\"For what?\"</p>\n<p>\"Everything. Not abandoning me to the Drow. For keeping me away from Dimzad and his chains. Even though I've only put you all in greater danger now.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ah, nonsense. There is always danger for people like us. Where is the fun, without a good arm wrestling session?\"</p>\n<p>\"Speak for yourself,\" Naami giggled. \"You have so much muscle.\"</p>\n<p>\"It makes my charm,\" Aviana said. \"And you have… <em>negative</em> muscle, really. You are eating meat? And plenty of soup?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes mum,\" Naami teased. \"I'm just naturally small.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hmmm. Doesn't hurt to make sure. I'll ask Shalkoc to cook a healthy breakfast for you. Dawn shouldn't be too far, now.\"</p>\n<p>In the windowless room, it was impossible to be sure. Naami stood gingerly but her legs were steady enough for a dance now. She could not resist a little hop and a skip out of the room, to prove she could. She was not afraid anymore. In the tower's main hall, a pale light touched the high windows, making the floor tiles gleam. Motes of dust glittered in the air, reminding Naami to tease Fearghas about cleaning up the place. Soon her friends would wake up, and they would all gather for breakfast. The nightmare would really be gone then, dispelled by daylight and the party's noise, by hot tea and sweet treats. It would come back; Naami was certain of it. Confronting her fear was not the same as healing from it. When the nightmare returned she would be ready to face it again, as many times as it took. Aviana took her leave to be about her morning stretches; left to herself, Naami gave her face a thorough wash, and changed into her blue dress.</p>"

The high elves of Aethel'eren (an island far east of Quadira) use ley lines in their magic.</p><p>A temple to Nethys, goddess of magic, buried under the Redwind Sands, could contain information about lichdom.</p><p>Shadows are reflections of strong emotions or events in the Material Plane that leave echoes in the Shadowfell. This can also happen the other way around, though it is a lot rarer.</p><p>Fearghas reads us the Duergar Creation Myth, as told by the Dwarves. In the tower, we find another version, as told by the Duergar. It is quite different… The Duergar claim they disobeyed their god Torag out of curiosity and yearning for understanding, and were burnt by Azgal, the Ebon Fire. The Duergar look down on the other Dwarves for their blind obedience to Torag. In Ukgluz, there was a temple to Azgal, and the stolen scepter was the Scepter of Azgal.</p><p>Fearghas, Plex, Kyrin, and myself have been doing research in the library. Aviana has been playing chess with Emilio and bugging Fearghas for a gravity-enhanced gym room. Aviana won every chess game by virtue of neither her, nor Emilio knowing the rules. They gambled, and somehow Emilio won 800 gold?! I learn that last time Plex' curse tried to teleport him away from the tower, he got stuck in a teleportation loop between the curse pulling him away, and the tower pulling him back, for hours. Which made him very nauseous.</p><p>After reading Draconic Aspects and their Kin, we theorise that the eye of Dahak held by the king of Lessia contains half the dragon's soul. We suspect it's the left eye, that of evil. How frightening… where would the right eye have gone? Does Vrazzak the Lich have it? We attempt to figure out whether Plex is left-handed or right-handed to judge if he is evil. Aviana chucks a ball at him to see which hand he catches it with. He catches it with telekinesis. All our plans are in tatters.</p><p>We wonder if Dahak's right eye might cure the king of Lessia.</p><p>Vrazzak supposedly is friends with Dam'ghur (the undead mage whom we beat up after Shalkoc picked up his little finger that he is now waving around as a wand). Their friendship consists of trying to kill each other. If we want to find out more (read: when we have time to find out more), we could start in the Redwind Sands!</p><p>Kyrin's shadow wiggles of its own volition. She does not know why. We talk about how both the Shadowfell and the Feywild are very susceptible to emotion and intent. Plex says the Shadowfell is… taking over the Feywild? That's terrifying! Shalkoc says we should go to Hell to meet Zariel, as she wants to meet \"the angel slayer\" (that's me). Emilio suggests he can claim to be the angel slayer, to protect me. Shalkoc says I can just pretend I am a regular angel slayer. What in the world. Kyrin gives me a cookie.</p><p>We shuffle to bed at 2am.</p><p>Plex is dragged to bed while still restrained on his floating disc.</p><p>WE SLIP ON THE STAIRS BECAUSE PLEX TRAPPED THEM WITH SOAP.</p><p>Ouchie.</p><p>Fearghas wants to kill Plex. He cleans up the stairs with Prestidigitation. I help Plex back to his disc, as he was knocked off by most of us tumbling down the stairs. We end up in the kitchen for a 2am snack before going to bed. Totally did not go to the wrong floor of the tower, we would never. I call dibs on the tiny room with the plants. Fearghas finds a hidden door behind the wall of one of the toilets. <s>the diarrhea room</s> Shalkoc tests every bed to find the most comfortable one. Fearghas finds a Dispelling Stone, and deposits Plex into a hammock. Fearghas wanders to a room adjacent to the plant room I picked, and he drops into a spike pit?! I rush to help him, and he only mutters \"ow\". I throw him a rope and he climbs out, muttering.</p><p>The room seems full of stolen stuff, and it contains a wand that makes Fearghas feel so tired… it's a Wand of Catnap! Actually quite a powerful item. Plex rolls around his hammock with great satisfaction, until he falls out. Fearghas pauses his bedtime reading to say \"I'm not getting him\". Plex tries to get back to the hammock. We have pleasant quiet for the rest of the night.</p><hr><p><strong>Wednesday 29</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> of Nonus, 1497</strong></p><p><strong>10:22</strong></p><p><strong>Short rest</strong></p><p>On our way to get breakfast, we descend to the <s>ouija room</s> letter room. Plex is there, and he made a lineart of his face with the bones littering the room. What. We need to:</p><ul><li><p>figure out where the Drow are</p></li><li><p>deal with Shalkoc's and Fearghas' contracts</p></li><li><p>figure out what is happening with the Shadowfell</p></li><li><p>track down the Lich</p></li></ul><p>I ask whether we want this done before or after lunch. We agree that dealing with Matron Vandree is the most urgent, as she will come for Kyrin and me as soon as she can. Plex can move freely again, and Aviana wants her chain back. Plex has the zoomies; he is stress-testing the pathfinding algorhythm, running laps around the tower. That's a lot of magic words! Fearghas shuffles back to the library for more research on the Astral Sea and the castle mentioned by Lady Vandree. No luck, so we discuss how to find the Matron. Kyrin pulls out the House Vandree crest she found at the campsite; it has blood on it, so it would be useful in divination magic to locate its owner.</p><p>The crest is a cloak pin in the shape of crossed daggers. It is not magical. We have no idea how to make use of it.</p><p>We consider going to Heaven, and waiting and seeing whether Matron Vandree comes to get me. Plex suggests going to the Feywild, to Mennon. I ask who Mennon is; Plex casually responds Mennon is an archfey. I squeak at this. Aerelia gets carrot up his nose again. Must be a surge, a major one.</p><p>I get a Sending from Matron Vandree and repeat it to the party:</p><p><em>Little traitor, remember your friend Madr? He had some words for you. \"Did we not take care of you? Protect you? You had to run to your kin of cowering surface-dwellers!\" I might have misheard some parts, his words were difficult to make out between his screams. I'll let you know if he has more to say.</em></p><p>I panic and tell the party that the Matron is torturing my friend, and I will surrender myself to her so I can help Madr. They suggest I send a message to Madr first to try and ascertain the Drows' whereabouts, and if this fails, I will surrender myself. I use one of my scrolls of Sending and message Madr:</p><p><em>Madr, this is Naami. Where are you? Are you okay? I will come free you, whether you want it or not.</em></p><p>He responds:</p><p><em>Naami? Are you ok? The Lady told of your treachery so I'm surprised you're still alive! Stay out of this! Don't come for me!</em></p><p>Fearghas and me discuss whether Matron Vandree could have intercepted my Sending and tampered with it somehow. He doesn't know of any way, and enquires about the nature of Lady Vandree's magic. Shalkoc suggests I message Lady Vandree and claim I've captured a dragon. Somehow the discussion ends up in whether to tie up Shalkoc, which makes Fearghas very frustrated. We discuss where to go and draw the Matron to (or more likely, her minions), and settle on someplace near Lessia.</p><p>Shalkoc whips up some food for us; spicy poultry for Fearghas, spicy chocolate biscuits for me (delicious!), a stack full of meat burger for Kyrin (Fearghas asks where he got the meat from), a herby donut for Emilio (he is very happy), then after Aviana grumbles about Emilio getting a donut, Shalkoc whips up another donut for her. It's covered in dark sauce… it's chocolate sauce, right? Lastly, Shalkoc grills up a fish for himself. Then he realises he forgot to make a snack for Plex, and cooks a green salad with some weird stuff on it. Supposedly it tastes like meat, but it isn't meat? How does he do that…</p><p>Fearghas teleports us to Promise around noon. For Emilio and Kyrin, it's the first time they see the floating island! Fearghas gives them a warm welcome to the island. Kyrin asks how it stays up, and Fearghas explains that the wind crystals are degrading and need research and repairs. Aviana says they are enslaving air elementals. What??</p><p>I use another scroll of Sending to contact Matron Vandree:</p><p><em>Matron, please do not hurt Madr. I will surrender myself. I am on the floating island above Lessia.</em></p><p>(By the way I get a surge and I am unable to read for a week. Very tempted to burn a spell slot to remove that.)</p><p>She responds immediately:</p><p><em>Oh such innocence. During all of your time with us, you still haven't understood, have you? I don't care about where you are and I don't need to. To punish you for your disgression, all I need to know is where those you care about are.</em></p><p>Kyrin and Fearghas guess that Matron Vandree is making me suffer for fun, and eventually she will come to see it with her own eyes. Therefore our best bet is to wait for her cruelty to get the better of her. Oh, joy.</p><p>Plex placed traps around the doors in the cabin while nobody was looking. Oh, further joy.</p><p>Shalkoc's cat-sized dragon Ivernia perches on his shoulder, and Aviana's frost wolf Kaar is hanging around the chicken coop. Aviana asks for food for the dog. That wolf is very hungry, and so is the dragon, and we will need to resupply food soon. Kyrin feeds the dragon some dried meat; somehow she doesn't like it, and spit on Kyrin's face. She's devoured similar food before…</p><p>Kyrin feeds Kaar, and he gives her a thorough lick, drenching her in drool. How friendly!</p><p>We go upstairs so Kyrin and Emilio can pick a room. Plex doesn't remember which doors he has trapped, so he uses a magical key to make more doors. Shalkoc triggers one of the goblin's traps, and he jumps out of the way. Plex says to tell him before opening doors. Fearghas does not tell Plex, opens the door to his room, and triggers a trap. A stone hurtles towards him, whacking him in the head. The stone shouts \"Ow!\" and a light powder explodes in the air, making Fearghas sneeze violently. He also explodes at Plex, telling him to remember where he puts his traps!</p><p>Emilio gives up on this whole bullshit and snuggles up in a bed.</p><p>\"Are you gonna use Plex as a hammer?\" - Aerelia</p><p>Fearghas uses a spellgem of Sending to ask Kali to come to the cabin.</p><p>I ask if I can examine everyone and check for lingering injuries, to make sure we are all in fighting shape. I knock on Emilio's door and he is… not… here? He's woven a cocoon of purple light around him and is just floating in there, eyes glowing. Since when can he do that? I guess I'll ask again later…</p><p>Plex plants magic mushrooms from the Feywild, what could go wrong? I check everyone for injuries but they are all doing fine, it's a relief. Aviana is thankful for my care and I get inspiration!</p><p>Kali arrives and Fearghas casts Comprehend Languages so he can understand her Druidic language. She looks at us with all her 6 red eyes, Kyrin is taken aback. Fearghas asks Kali to go to Lessia and rescue his parents. She is a little doubtful on how to carry out the task. Fearghas asks Kali how much she was paid to kill Aviana. To… KILL… Aviana? So Kali is an assassin, and also a bachelorette apparently.</p><p>Kyrin shapeshifts into her child form, which intrigues Kali (don't blame her). Kali says she was paid 8000 gold to assassinate Aviana, and she only took the contract as a side job. Aviana is offended by the low price on her head, and argues she should be worth at least 10 000 gold. Fearghas grumbles, and offers Kali 5000 gold to rescue his parents. She asks for double. Fearghas barters and rolls a natural 20! Kali says she just wanted to test him, and agrees to the 5000 gold.</p><p>Kali says we can contact her by speaking to any of the spiders here. Spiders understand common? the Drow says they don't understand in the way we can have a conversation, but they will go to her if anything is up. I ask Kali if she would plant the Springseeds for me, and care for them. I show her one of the seeds, she is very intrigued. She says the seeds must have come from a beautiful place. My mind flashes back to the celestial warped into a fiend, and the fight for our lives in the Sibriex lair; I get choked up, unable to get a word out. Kali assumes the place I got the seeds was so beautiful I am at a loss for words. I let her believe that.</p><p>Kali enquires about Kyrin's shapeshifting ability. Kyrin explains it's part of who she is, not something learnt. Kali seems sad about this, and says a lot of people would pay good money to hire her. Kyrin says yes, she was working for the Drow, it did not go well. Kali is very confused at the talk of the egg and the Sibriex lair. I kindly ask that we don't speak of this further. Sarenrae knows, I have plenty of nightmares as it is.</p><p>Kyrin starts chatting with Kali telepathically using Psychic Whispers. Kali also says she can teach us certain spells, given time. She can teach me to speak with the spiders! I definitely want to spend some time with her, not only for the spells, I want to plant my trees! Kali casually mentions that the two easternmost doors are trapped, so Kyrin decides to sleep on the couch, it's safer than trying to open doors.</p><p>Kali invites Kyrin and me to join her on the other side of the island, where it is much quieter (glares at Plex). Aviana wants Kali to teach her many knots, so she can tie up Plex. Kali demonstrates the restraining of short people by spitting spiderweb on Kyrin in child form, and wraps her up in a spider cocoon so she cannot move at all. Aviana is interested, spits on the ground, doesn't seem to work. Kali slices Kyrin free with exceptional dagger skills. We imagine if Kali wanted to hurt Kyrin, Kyrin would have been dead <em>last week</em>.</p><p>Kali can use ZA WARUDO with needles and a Time Stop spell. Aviana knows this, and confidently says Kali would not hurt a fly. I think Kali EATS flies. No offense.</p>"

          "content": "<p><strong>Wednesday 29</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> Nonus, 1497</strong></p><p><strong>18:55</strong></p><p>Kyrin and me return to the cabin after spending time conversing with Kali. I tried to communicate with spiders, no luck yet. Emilio <s>hatches</s> wakes up from his power nap. Fearghas is enjoying some rare chilling time, reading. Shalkoc is teaching tricks to Ivernia and trying to teach her to speak. It's working about as well as my spider-speaking endeavours; she is not really getting the memo that her mouth can be opened for purposes other than eating or breathing ice. She picks the second one to use on Shalkoc, giving him a frosty mug. Which only inspires Shalkoc to use assistance from Ivernia to make frozen treats. The creativity!</p><p>Kyrin asks where Kaar is. We hear him trampling around on the floor above. I wonder whether Aviana is teaching Kaar to speak too, but we hear growling and a harpy screech. \"Clean your paws before you step on my clothes!\" Fearghas' temple vein starts to pulse as he conspicuously looks away from the ceiling. He is still under the effect of a surge that causes him to track dirt everywhere he goes.</p><p>Some random older woman from Promise comes by, walking a rat-sized dog. Shalkoc, thanks to an earlier surge, gets on his knees, eyes wide, saying he has never seen anything as holy as this dog. Shalkoc tries to prompt a religious conversation about the dog being the saviour of all, while the old lady stammers the dog Hufflepuff is her little darling. Shalkoc wants to steal the lady's dog, but the sweet lady gets terrified by Ivernia who is casually flying in. The dragon makes a beeline for the dog, looking forward to a bite-sized snack. Shalkoc steps in and picks up the dog; she shivers in his hands like she's about to straight up die from fear. The old lady passes out from sheer terror.</p><p>I try to convince Shalkoc to let the dog live its life. He locks Ivernia out and begins feeding and worshipping his new god. Fearghas tiredly asks me where Shalkoc got the dog. Kaar is barking, Aviana is shouting, and Ivernia flies up and makes another dive for the dog. Fearghas tries to get Shalkoc to give up the dog. He is unwilling. I rush to the aid of the dog's owner who is still lying in a heap close to the cabin. Emilio tries to bait Ivernia with treats to get her away from Shalkoc's newfound deity. He fails to get Ivernia's attention, but <em>by god</em> did he get the dog's attention, and she is going for Emilio with all her tiny might. Kyrin is giggling her bum off, I don't blame her, I'd do the same if I wasn't trying to revive the poor lady.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, Fearghas casts Remove Curse at 6th level on Shalkoc.</p><ul><li><p>he no longer sees the doggie as a god</p></li><li><p>he loses his 3rd-level spell slot</p></li><li><p>he loses his -1 to constitution</p></li><li><p>he loses his +1 to intelligence</p></li></ul><p>All liquids within 60 feet of him still transform into lukewarm water, the next pig he sees is still a god, and he is still black. He now sees the dog as food instead of god, and tries to feed her to Ivernia, who is making puppy eyes so she can eat the pup. Fearghas and Emilio do their best to protect the dog. Emilio begins to wrestle with the dragon, surprisingly successfully, as Fearghas grabs the dog and immediately gets bitten. Shalkoc coaxes Ivernia away with the promise of treats. Fearghas grumbles at Kyrin because she could have helped instead of giggling herself half to death.</p><p>I manage to wake the old lady up, explain what is going on, and apologise for Shalkoc's behaviour. Fearghas shows up with the dog dangling from his finger. The old lady yanks the dog from Fearghas' finger and invites us over for cake. Her name is Rose. Very sweet. She returns to Promise, insisting we come over for cake. Fearghas sees he cannot keep me away from cake, but I suggest we go <strong>without</strong> Shalkoc.</p><p>Fearghas and me return to the cabin where Shalkoc is feeding treats to Ivernia. She is behaving, likely due to being very hungry. Emilio is flabbergasted. I ask him, first time? This amuses Fearghas. We sit down like civilised people, and Kyrin talks about our conversation with Kali. We get a lot of extra information on the Drow sisters <strong>Filrae</strong> (my boss who was exiled) and <strong>Minae</strong> (the sister who is now at the head of House Vandree).</p><p>Kali mentioned one <strong>Velkyn Arkenaii</strong>, a friend of her mother's who fled the city Ul'ath'tallar, where House Vandree has great influence. Kali hasn't seen Velkyn in over 50 years, but supposes he might be in Aethel'eren (which means \"noble lands\" in Elvish). Or more likely on one of the surrounding isles, which we know next to nothing about. That's far away, not that it matters a lot to us, I'm sure it's beautiful country, we'll add this to the long, long list of our quests. <s>Nagaaaaaaaaaaai.</s></p><p>We do need to report to Zariel first, or we might be toast. Literally.</p><p>We discuss what to do with Promise, whether it will crash into mountains (not unless Shalkoc wants it), how to develop it (we need craftsmen), how to have people travel to and from it, what is the most urgent (building the Academy to keep Promise aloft).</p><p>The problem is, Fearghas can't teleport us to Hell until Saturday. We could ask Zariel to teleport us there, but since we don't really have much to report, she probably won't take kindly to it. I am not an angel slayer, dang it Shalkoc! We consider casually flying Promise all the way to Aethel'eren but it will take a while. Fearghas wants to wait for Kali to rescue his parents. Kali mentioned she had connections in Taldor; we might be able to employ scouts from there to go to Ildilas and investigate the situation!</p><p>Kali goes off to Lessia to scout. Kyrin goes to bother Aviana and Kaar because FLUFFY. Kali returns around midnight, alone. She left a letter for Fearghas' parents so they know they are being rescued. Kyrin asks about her connections in Taldor; I mention the need for scouts to Ildilas. Fearghas brews up Potions of Supreme Healing. He advises Shalkoc to ask around in Promise for craftsmen.</p><p>Fearghas blows up at Plex about the mushroom pit in front of the door. I offer to help him relocate the mushroom pit so it's not in the way, while Fearghas stomps off. Kyrin considers cleaning her Sunblade just to mess up the Light-Shy mushrooms… While us small people are gardening, the grown-ups, plus Kyrin, are having serious talk with Kali about adventurers to hire. I join and outline three profiles of people I want as scouts:</p><ul><li><p>a sailor with knowledge about the weather</p></li><li><p>a scribe who will be taking detailed notes</p></li><li><p>a scout who is particularly perceptive and notices details to report to the scribe</p></li></ul><p>It would be great to have a person capable of flight, but I'm not counting on it. At first I add I don't want the scouts to endanger themselves, but Kali, Fearghas, and Emilio talk me down. If the adventurers take the job, they are aware of the risks and know they may die. I can't consider myself responsible for protecting them. I can only promise to try… Fearghas growls about messing up his alchemy. We discuss hiring someone to gather herbs for him to <s>screw up</s> brew more potions. Aviana flexes to inspire Fearghas to roll better. It does not work out.</p><p>Most of us go to bed. Kyrin wants to stay up and wait for Kali, as she isn't tired. Plex goes to the kitchen, curls up in a big pot, and goes to sleep. Fearghas is rage-sleeping.</p><hr><p><strong>Thursday 30</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> Nonus, 1497</strong></p><p><strong>06:00</strong></p><p>Kali returns early in the morning, floating in through the window in cloud form. She is accompanied by two other clouds, who turn into Fearghas' parents! Kali is not too happy, she says she's been seen by guards. Fearghas happily reunites with his parents, how sweet! His dad did not enjoy being a cloud, but his mum had a blast and a half. He promises to take her flying again some day.</p><p>Fearghas gives his parents his room in the cabin. Shalkoc goes to cook up a big breakfast, finds Plex sleeping in the cauldron which is humming with the goblin's snoring. Fearghas introduces the party to his parents, throwing in a warning about Plex. He bargains with Shalkoc to pay Kali in coin, not in diamonds.</p><p>Fearghas' dad is called <strong>Dulum</strong>, and his mum is called <strong>Ysolde</strong>.</p><p>Aviana takes out the Null-steel chain, wraps Plex up in it and lifts him out of the cooking pot. She unchains him and lets him run free, ranting to Shalkoc about \"not eating food cooked on Plex\". The goblin makes a shopping list to go to the market. Ysolde scowls at Plex, don't blame her.</p><p>After breakfast, we all head to the settlement for various errands. On his quest for spices, Shalkoc sees on the market a wonderful, divine-looking pig. He is enlightened and kneels, worshipping the pig. Fearghas and me discuss casting Remove Curse, but it will take a spell slot of 7th-level at least. I could cast at 9th but that would cost me a lot, so Fearghas tries to persuade Shalkoc to purchase the pig and put it in a pen at the cabin so it can live its happiest pig life. Shalkoc is unwilling to be separated from his lord and saviour, Mr Oinkers. Fearghas argues that we can't take the pig to Hell, and it will be very well protected at the cabin, what with all the traps Plex put around it.</p><p>Shalkoc buys the pig for an obscene amount of money (10 gold). I distract Aviana by shopping for clothes, we have a nice time shopping for dresses and shoes; she also searches for various supplies, most of which I grow very concerned about. An extra-long, teleportation resistant dog-leash? She's putting that on Plex, isn't she. What does she want herring, potato, and carrots for? Taking advantage of the diversion, Fearghas walks away with his parents, explaining he will be away with the party for a while, showing them around. They ask for a shop where they could work as alchemists.</p><p>Plex gives a ridiculous amount of gold to 2 children for them to gather sticks and bring them to the cabin. He looks for paint, there is no paint, so he goes to the bar, making the DM cry because he does not know the price of drinks. Plex wants to do the equivalent of buying a round, but for the whole city, for 2 or 3 days. Aerelia begins to calculate. Plex is aghast at the amount of people living in Promise, all without paint.</p><p>5000 gold per day to buy a drink to everyone in Promise. Plex decides to throw a secret party, and pays the barkeep 300 gold. Nobody knows there is a secret party going on at 8:00 am. Plex goes to buy a pig. Aviana grumbles about her Kaar. Plex drinks on his own, in this fine morning. Throwing a secret party gets him inspiration. What even is going on. Thankfully, the morning drink distracts Plex from sneaking into a pasture and stealing the bells from the cows.</p><p>Aviana is looking for sunflowers and shampoo. Nobody knows what those are. She speaks to Shalkoc about the party's food stores, then buys 2 handmirrors. Why? As my mum would say, \"only god and the little piggies know\", and according to Shalkoc those two are one and the same. Aviana buys cobbler's tools, leatherworker's tools, and a lot of rope to craft an anti-magic leash for Plex.</p><p>Shalkoc happily goes to Glim's Emporium of Exotic Flavours buy spices, but the spice trade is not going well. On the account of there being no trade to speak of, since the common folk can't get off the island. Glim heartily recommends Quadiran cuisine, which causes Shalkoc to drool and possibly yank the island in the general direction of Quadira for a moment. Fearghas hears of Shalkoc's burning desire to go to Al-Qasir, and vetoes it on the account that Quadira is <strong>fiercely</strong> anti-magic.</p><p>Fearghas asks Shalkoc to fly the island to Taldor so people can trade. We make a stop at the cabin on the way to drop off our pigs. As we walk, Kyrin mentions her foster mother, a herbalist and healer who is also a tailor. She sounds like a wonderful person! Aviana wants to meet her immediately for duck-sized clothes, which severely confuses Kyrin.</p><p>Shalkoc wants to build a temple for his pig-god. Kyrin pleads that we don't have time for this! Fearghas casts Minor Illusion to make a pig-temple. Shalkoc is delighted.</p><p>We finally head to the Locus. Emilio is very worried about going to Hell, he's sweating bullets anticipating it might be like the Void. Plex admits he stole something last time he was in Hell. Aviana says it was her sanity. She had one before? Plex confesses he stole a bunch of Silver Tears, and he also freed Glim the spice trader, who was enslaved to a devil. Oh dear.</p><p>Plex teleports us to the Bronze Citadel in Avernus. Fearghas hands a spellgem of Sending to Shalkoc so he can contact Zariel. Emilio remarks that it's pretty hot in here. You don't say? Fireballs are raining from the sky, and the air stinks of sulphur and soot. Kyrin asks about Hell so we don't get ourselves fried on the spot. Fearghas explains about the paramount importance of the letter of the law, that there is NO tourist tax, don't believe that. Plex and Aviana want their money back. She says she bought NFTs in Hell, oh no.</p><p>Four pit fiends arrive to escort us. They're massive winged devils taller than Aviana. She claims they love music. I'm sure they're very polite, but I'd really rather not piss them off. We get asked to show our papers, but Emilio, Kyrin, and myself don't have any… The devil behind the counter calls his manager. A well-dressed, very impressive devil jurist shows up with arrest warrants for Fearghas, Aviana, Shalkoc, and Plex. They are to go to jail and wait for their case to be handled. Fearghas asks on what charges? The devil says, public indecency and theft. Indecency? In Hell?!</p><p>Getting our papers done would take… 6 months?! Kyrin says Zariel wants to see me, then tries to charm the devil, arguing the pit fiends were sent by Zariel to escort us to her. Fearghas says Zariel wanted to meet us before the end of the week. The devil jurist is covertly asking for a bribe. Kyrin speaks to the jurist about \"greasing the wheel\". She's still in her child form, and the devil looks on her with pride. A child who is trying to bribe him? That child will grow into a fine adult, for sure. The jurist lowers the price to 26 soul coins. Fearghas hands them over. The bag of scolding roasts him, which amuses the devils.</p><p>We have papers now! We enter the city, still surrounded by our pit fiends guards. They lead us to the courtyard in front of Zariel's tower. Plex hangs out at the back of the group, uncommonly quiet. Fearghas asks if we should go in by ourselves, as our guards aren't moving further. They give noncommittal answers… Kyrin simply walks into the tower. One does not simply walk into Zariel's tower! But Fearghas follows, then Emilio, then me. Aviana is busy drafting a legal complaint and wants to sit somewhere to finish writing it, but there is nowhere to sit, because this is Hell. Shalkoc follows me, and Plex trails after him as Aviana closes the march.</p><p>Shalkoc, Plex, and Aviana see the pit fiends grinning knowingly, like we've walked into their trap. Plex says \"stooooooop I don't want to go into the building anymore\", Aviana asks for the Glasses of True Seeing, wink wink nudge nudge? Fearghas puts them on, spots a scrying sensor above the door, but that's it. Aviana asks the pit fiends what is going on. They grin and say we don't know the rules of this place. We ask, and they say entering the tower is forbidden \"since last time\", and being ignorant of the rules does not protect us.</p><p>After a frustrating exchange with the pit fiends, we go back out into the courtyard and wait. The ground is dirty and hot, there is nowhere to sit, and the heat is extreme. After FIVE excruciating hours, Zariel glides down from the sky and lands behind us. She praises Shalkoc as a \"good little pet\" and asks him to introduce the angel slayer. He pushes me forward. I am frozen in fear. Emilio throws up his hands because Shalkoc just ruined the plan.</p><p>Zariel walks up to me uncomfortably close, looks down, and stares into my SOUL. She raises my chin up with the stump of her hand, and interrogates me. I'm shaking in my boots, saying I only accidentally killed an angel. I try to explain, but only squeak. Kyrin offers moral support. Appreciated. She also offers Psychic Whispers to establish a makeshift telepathic bond! Even more appreciated. Fearghas frantically thinks to Shalkoc to NOT say anything stupid.</p><p>I answer Zariel's questions, though vaguely, with the strict truth; that I killed an angel under very specific circumstances that are not in my power to re-create. She is amused by the irony of making everything worse by trying to help. Turning to Shalkoc, she says she expected something different when he spoke of an angel slayer. She forces me to look up and says that I don't have the strength to slay an angel, seeing how I'm trembling. I do not protest or deny. She asks me very clearly if I am capable to go to Heaven to sow discord and do murder. I say I am not capable of that.</p><p>Emilio opens his mouth to speak, but before he can get three words out, Zariel grabs him by the throat and lifts him to his tiptoes, inflicting heavy damage, poisoning him, blinding him, and deafening him. Plex shimmies away from Zariel as she tells Shalkoc he has no excuse for disrespecting her. He tries to apologise, and ask her to not kill Emilio. To which she responds by squeezing Emilio's neck tighter. He uses his cat-eared Hoodie of Stars to dip into the Astral Plane. Zariel rounds on Shalkoc, demanding what excuse he has for this.</p><p>Shalkoc tries to explain.</p><p>It does not go well.</p><p>It really does not go well, please let us leave.</p><p>Zariel explains life and death to us. Mostly death. All to say that Shalkoc has no way out of his contract because as a dragon, he does not really die when his body perishes, he just comes back to his hoard. His soul doesn't get stripped of individuality and judged by Pharasma, which constitutes <em>death</em>. Zariel wants to bully Shalkoc into paying reparations because his \"pet\" (Emilio) disrespected her (by trying to speak without being spoken to) and therefore she wants another contract. She will wait out Emilio's return so she can trade his life for something we offer her.</p><p>Shalkoc asks Zariel what she wants. She says Kyrin and me look \"innocent enough\". She wants us to enter the 3rd layer of Heaven and place a portal there. Kyrin says she'll do it. I'm thinking to Shalkoc to NOT ACCEPT THIS. Zariel conjures up a contract, an inkwell that looks filled with fire, and a pitch-black quill.</p><p>Aerelia steps away for a bit to write the contract. We collectively sweat through our pants. My cheeks are a rainpipe. He returns with a contract, even worse than I thought as it has a deadline AND a clause to not breathe a word of the contract or the artifact to anyone else.</p><p>Kyrin signs the contract. Zariel smiles. We are free to leave, Emilio included. Fearghas casts Sending to Emilio on the Astral Plane to tell him it's safe to return.</p><p><s>Aviana mutters about how this is unlawful. Zariel grabs her by the throat. Domi rolls a natural one on the CON save, pops inspiration, still fails it. Aviana uses Legendary Vigor to resist the damage and resumes babbling. Fearghas is definitely having an aneurysm, considers using magic to shut her up, realises she will equally resist it, and gives up.</s></p><p>This did not happen, thank the Heavens. Not that they could help us now. Not that we would wish them to, considering <em>recent events</em>.</p><p>Zariel makes it clear that we are not only free to leave, but also and mainly <em>expected</em> to leave. We proceed to exit as fast as we possibly can. Plex goes to teleport us out, gets a surge that makes the weather within 1 mile of him be the opposite of what it naturally is, so it starts snowing and freezing in Hell.</p><p>We return to Promise and Emilio deeply apologises for creating this situation. Nobody is mad at him, he didn't know. None of us knew. We return to the cabin defeated. Fearghas establishes a telepathic bond and makes it very clear that NOBODY must learn of that contract until Kyrin has opened the portal in Heaven, or our souls are forfeit. Well, her soul is forfeit. But we're in this together now, as we are all complicit.</p><p>We discuss Zariel's priorities. The Locus, <em>our</em> Locus, was created by Heaven and Hell working together. Now that Aviana broke it, and the planes are converging again, demons can go and fight anything they want (not JUST Hell). Which messed up the Blood War, and put the devils at liberty to go fck up the angels.</p><p>We discuss how to wriggle out of our contracts. Fearghas' death would release him from his, we are pretty much certain. We theorise it might also work for Shalkoc, but we are less sure. We decide that we should go to Heaven next, and we look for ANY loopholes in the contract, with limited success.</p>"

It can make up to 7 creatures take a short rest in only 10 minutes, basically. Kyrin shows us the <strong>Beacon of Doom</strong> that Zariel has given her. We decide, reluctantly, to go to Heaven to fulfill her contract. We must wait for Saturday because we first need a long rest to recover high-level spell slots. Fearghas and me know that while anyone is allowed to enter Threshold, the first layer of Heaven, we can only reach higher levels with an invitation. There is a single, winding path up <strong>Mount Celestia</strong>, from which we must never stray. That is the only way to ascend between levels. We immediately start discussing ways to bypass the invitation (sneaking, forging). I don't think that's a good idea…</p><p>Fearghas casts <strong>Legend Lore</strong> as a ritual, because he can apparently? He investigates the 3rd level of Heaven, <strong>Venya</strong>. It's colder than the other levels, snowy mountains. There are cities in valleys connected by roads and bridges. This layer focuses on craftsmanship and community. <strong>Torag</strong>'s realm is located there. It's much less defended than the 1st and 2nd level… logically. Any dangers there are mainly natural, like avalanches. Nobody expects <s>the Spanish Inquisition</s> an attack on this level.</p><p>Aviana decides to buy a lot of chocolate/confectionaries, sneak it into Shalkoc's <strong>Snack Pack</strong> (Bag of Holding but for food), and bring it to the angels as a show of kindness. Shalkoc considers eating up all the treats, then offering himself to the celestials. We go talk to the Elder of Promise, a priest of <strong>Sarenrae</strong> called <strong>Gavel</strong>. He gives us a very exact definition of Lawful Good. We discuss whether a Divination spell like <strong>Augury</strong> would fail Kyrin's contract. Depending on the wording, it very much could.</p><hr><p><strong>Friday, 1</strong><sup><strong>st</strong></sup><strong> of Decimus, 1497</strong></p><p><strong>19:05</strong></p><p>After a day of resting, talking, and spellscribing, we are all in the cabin when we see a longship on the lake, being dragged ashore. Aviana and Fearghas go to meet the sailors. They have mentioned being on good terms with the <strong>Frost Giants</strong>, and expecting a visit. Plex starts to scramble, searching the cabin for all manners of alcohol in case a party happens. We meet up with <strong>General Ragvond</strong>; the ground shakes beneath his feet. He could accidentally step on me… or on Plex… or on Kyrin in child form. Plex is hiding under a bush, potentially hiding several bottles of booze. Aviana welcomes the giant and Shalkoc offers food.</p><p>Ragvond says he was sent by <strong>Utgard-Loki</strong> to establish a trading post. There is also a personal request for us to help in the war against the <strong>Fire Giants</strong>, as there have been \"complications\". Aviana asks whether it is related to \"that giant ball of fire\". Ragvond is impressed; that's a close assumption. He likes Aviana, and he doesn't like a lot of people. The Fire Giants are using chains to enslave <strong>Magma Elementals</strong>, which are causing big disturbances for the Frost Giants. Loki would be in our debt if we travelled to the volcano of <strong>Surtur's Jaws</strong> in the fortress called <strong>Obsidian's Cradle</strong>, and retrieve <strong>Rovagug's Chains</strong>.</p><p>Kyrin uses <strong>Psychic Whispers</strong> so we can discuss this without risk of being overheard and breaking the contract. There is a little joking around with Ragvond, then Kyrin steps out of the shadows (nobody was seeing her, not even Plex who was hiding under a bush right next to her). Ragvond gives a start like an elephant being startled by a mouse, saying he nearly stepped on her. Size isn't everything!! Them lumbering people, really…</p><p>Ragvond invites us aboard the ship, where a 10-feet-high anchor which apparently is for us? It is a <strong>Transdimensional Anchor</strong>. With it, we are given a chain that gradually becomes translucent, until the links disappear. He challenges Aviana to carry the chain, and drops it into her hands. It is a <strong>Transdimensional Anchorchain</strong>, metaphysically bound to the anchor. The chain can transport us to the anchor by opening a portal, even across planes. We just need someone really REALLY strong to drag the chain!</p><p>Aviana grabs the anchor, pops a deadlift, and jumps to the middle of the island. Kyrin sneaks underdeck. The ship rocks brutally and Emilio, Plex, and myself drop down into the hold. Plex immediately pops Feather Fall. Ragvond is laughing his bum off, and asks where the beer is (as this is what Promise is trading with the Frost Giants).</p><p><s>Aviana deletes herself accidentally.</s></p><p>Fearghas warns the brewer that Frost Giants are on the way, very eager to try some good ale. Having plonked the anchor down close to the town, Aviana returns and we party with the giants.</p><hr><p><strong>Sunday 3</strong><sup><strong>rd</strong></sup><strong> of Decimus, 1497</strong></p><p><strong>08:45</strong></p><p><strong>Long rest</strong></p><p>Fearghas does some very risky alchemy, which fails despite Aviana's inspiring abs. I yell at Shalkoc for a solid 5 minutes, he offers me a big serving of <strong>Lovely Honey Cookies</strong>, shaped like a bee and with a flavour of spicy honey. They're good. They're really good. I realise I've drawn my dagger during my rant, sheathe it, and stomp off to brew a pot of tea to go with the cookies. There are more bee cookies for Fearghas and Plex, while Emilio snacks on a comforting jacket potato and Kyrin tucks into a big fish steak. Aviana gets a plate of \"jumping dumplings\", rhubarb-filled treats that are supposed to prevent falling damage. Great for climbers. We hope it works. <s>Attention chute de pierres.</s> Shalkoc cooks some strange mushrooms with lavender for himself. Are those safe to eat? Anything is safe to eat for him but those fungi look suspiciously like something that would give you hallucinations for hours…</p><p>We head to the <strong>Locus</strong> to teleport to Heaven. Fearghas opens a portal and whisks us away to Heaven's Shore. We arrive in the middle of a fierce battle between angels and devils. A host of angels tries to get to us as we materialise, but they are cut down. One lone angel survives, severely wounded and unable to fly. He welcomes us, introduces himself as <strong>Ezeriel</strong>, and immediately offers protection to Heaven's Gate. There are far too many devils for us to fight, and all we can hope to do is get to the walls to take shelter.</p><p>Kyrin hides so well that nobody can see her, again. I summon <strong>Dwen</strong> and hop on his back, we are ready to make haste. Kyrin shoots the Arrow of Destiny (tm) at a <strong>Bone Devil</strong>, who is shooketh that one arrow deals so much damage. The devil flies towards her and brings a friend. When Kyrin shoots the devil, a glowing rolled newspaper appears above her head and whacks her for radiant damage. She's still in child form, maybe that is why.</p><p>Fearghas tells Ezeriel that we can help in the fight! The angel says we just have to get to the gates, 1000 feet away behind a host of devils. Fearghas casts a juicy Lightning Bolt, catching 4 <strong>Merregons</strong> in it. A big slipper appears behind him, glowing radiant like the morning sun, and slaps him hard over the ear. The Merregons shoot Ezeriel, he's barely standing anymore! Emilio shoots 3 <strong>Eldritch Blasts</strong> at the Bone Devil that still has Kyrin's arrow stuck in him, 1 blast misses but the others connect, and very briefly catch Ezeriel's attention. A golden hand appears and flicks Emilio's ear.</p><p>Aviana gives Ezeriel a bottle of <strong>Murgaxor's Elixir of Life</strong>, and plays the damsel in distress. Plex wants to be thrown 500 feet. The <strong>Horned Devil</strong> at the back attacks Ezeriel, and tells the 2 Bone Devils to charge forward and attack the angel. He is not asking, so the bony boys whack him.</p><p>Plex is the voice of reason.</p><p>Plex is the voice of<strong> REASON.</strong></p><p><span><strong><span>PLEX IS THE VOICE OF REASON.</span></strong></span></p><p>Plex says we need to save the angel. He casts <strong>Temporal Shunt</strong>, says \"trust me\" and shunts both a Bone Devil and the angel through TIME ITSELF. The other Bone Devil is hella confused. Another Horned Devil hurls flames at Fearghas, and suddenly the weather turns cloudy and rain begins to pour down. Wild magic surge, eh. One <strong>Narzugon</strong> riding a <strong>Nightmare</strong> rushes towards us and uses <strong>Terrifying Command</strong> and tries to frighten us. I roll a natural 1 on the save, pop inspiration, natural 20. Sunglasses descend on my eyes. Plex, Fearghas, and Shalkoc are frightened. Aviana pretends to be frightened with such conviction that she very nearly scares HERSELF. Emilio scowls at the devil, shrugs, and says \"I've seen worse.\"</p><p>One Bone Devil tries to spear Fearghas like a tasty snack on his polearm. He casts <strong>Shield</strong>, so the devil lashes at Kyrin with its stinger-tail, and slashes with his claws. Kyrin takes the first hit, and dodges the second one like a champ. Ezeriel comes back from the Temporal Shunt, immediately eats a magic surge that permanently lowers his Wisdom, and he has no clue what happened to him. He grumbles about \"vile Infernal magic\" and Plex just stands here like a guilty lime. In the middle of battle, Shalkoc asks about <strong>Shaik</strong>, whether anybody knows them. We yell at Shalkoc, what else is new?</p><p>Ezeriel tells us to follow him, tries to fly away, but his wings are too damaged. Shalkoc gets in a critical punch on one of the bony boys and stuns him. He advances on the bridge and shifts to <strong>Turtle Style</strong>, taunting the devils to shoot him. As if on cue, devil artillery slides into the chat. Arcane bombs fall, thankfully none of us gets hit. Emilio stares at the explosions, wondering at the flavour of them.</p><p>Kyrin shoots the stunned bony boy, he looks really beaten up at this point. I cast <strong>Mass Cure Wounds</strong>, healing Fearghas and Ezeriel's wounds, and removing Fearghas' and Plex' fear. Still riding Dwen, I run past the Bone Devil by the bridge, dodging his opportunity attack. Plex starts his turn with technical questions on which actions EXACTLY will trigger damage from the Realm Effect <strong>Forced Peace</strong>. If he shoves someone off a ledge, does he take damage? Then he uses <strong>Versatility through Unpredictability</strong> because as it turns out, after a 10-minute discussion on how/where to use <strong>Arcane Gate</strong>, it turns out he does not have Arcane Gate prepared. Just Plex things. Plex is trying to be a good green boy and generate some positive karma by slaughtering devils, and obeying angels. See earlier notes. Plex considers using his pride and joy, <strong>Jim's Lance of Compensation</strong>.</p><p>The Bone Devil grapples and stabs Ezeriel, somehow triggers a wild magic surge that blasts necrotic damage on anyone within 60ft, then heals him. Dwen dies on impact. Legitimately every time I summon my doggie, Aerelia murders him. My poor Dwen, next time we have a rest I'm just gonna sit and cradle the figurine and whisper happy things to him.</p><p>Well the surge causes the very damaged Bone Devil to heal up back to full, and then a <s>JIRRU BIIIIIMU</s> BEAM of light descends upon him and smites the shit out of him for being the first to damage most of the combatants present. What a rollercoaster. We just get to beat him up all over again. As an additional side effect, the wave of necrotic damage breaks the protection of Aviana's <strong>Amulet of Fragile Tranquility</strong> and she enters rage. Fearghas casts a <strong>Magic Missile</strong>, then throws in a <strong>Vicious Mockery</strong>. \"I've seen better skeletal structures on a diced chicken!\" But the Bone Devil does not know what a chicken is, and the insult falls flat. Chickens would probably insta-roast in Hell. Eggs would insta-boil. No wonder they don't know about the tasty birds.</p><p>Emilio grabs a cute little star from his cat-eared hoodie and throws it like a dart and OH GOD IT'S MAGIC MISSILES AND HE ROLLED MAX ON DAMAGE. He goes into <strong>Void Form</strong> and crunches (?) on an Essence Shard to activate <strong>Netherwalk</strong>. Imagine walking faster after eating, could not be me. I only get sleepy, more like Nethernap I guess.</p><p>\"Just leave the little child alone with the Bone Devil.\" - Aerelia, 2025.</p><p>Aviana leaves the little child alone with the Bone Devil. She jumps next to the Narzugon on his Nightmare, zapping him with the <strong>Cursed Thunderfeet</strong> (and getting divinely slapped for it), then continues down the bridge at a run, complaining \"you're ruining my damsel in distress moment!\". As a true damsel in distress, she uses her <strong>Battering Ram</strong>, crashing the Narzugon into Ezeriel and the Bone Devil. The Bone Devil turns into a Done Devil, and Ezeriel and the Narzugon are paralysed. Welp. Another charge yeets the devil into the water where he proceeds to sink.</p><p>The devils descend on the paralysed Ezeriel and knock him out. Well more like stab the light out of him. The Horned Devil then turns to Emilio and strangles him with his tail, grappling him. \"Devils really like strangling me!\" Wiesel says. And with 0 hesitation Domi replies \"They read your backstory.\" The devil nonchalantly makes a stab at Emilio, who swings himself like a pendulum to dodge the hit.</p><p>\"Shalkoc, you are good at two things. <strong>Healing is not one of them</strong>.\" - Aerelia and Karnack in perfect sync, like you'd think they must have rehearsed that.</p><p>So Shalkoc punches the Bone Devil in the rear end <s>Thousand Years of Pain</s>, cracking most of the remaining bones and moving right back to where he was. A perfect drive-by! The devils assume Ezeriel is dead so they try to whack Emilio. Another arcane bombardment misses all of us. Kyrin casually pulls out the <strong>Sun Blade</strong> and slaps a crit on the Bone Devil, jumping down from the tree and lopping its head off. In its last moments, the Bone Devil hears the trees speaking Changeling, he is scarred for life.</p><p>I pick up Dwen, back in his rock form, and kneel by Ezeriel to cast a 4th-level <strong>Cure Wounds</strong> on him, <strong>Heightened</strong> to 7th-level. He is thankful but says we really need to move, the next wave of devils is already coming! I hurry onto the next bridge. Plex is going through his spellbook backwards to find Arcane Gate and cast it. It does not work out. Fearghas burns a <strong>Dreamfeather</strong> to give him another chance, but Plex still cannot find the all-important spell. that's a 50% chance and we are on… 4 failures?</p><p>Fearghas grills 2 Merregons with a Lightning Bolt, and spits at the Horned Devil that he smells of elderberries or something (Vicious Mockery). \"Pleeeeeex?\" The goblin is working on it. He's never looked for a spell so hard in his life. A Narzugon appears NEXT TO ME. Nightmares do be fast. Emilio eats 3 shards for a <strong>Bloodrazor</strong>. So anyway, he started slashing. He lands a crit with <strong>Reaping Claws</strong>, earning inspiration for it! He rolls close to maximum damage, but in reaction the devil stings him and poisons him with his tail.</p><p>Some people work well under stress. Plex is not one of them. It might be easier if he could read? Aviana grapples the Narzugon and jumps halfway to Quadira with him, frying him on landing. A Horned Devil eats a surge and drops to 20% HP, yippeeeeee! Ezeriel eats a lot of fire damage, and goes down again. Emilio is getting forked. Shalkoc uses his Hand of Healing to get Ezeriel back on his feet.</p><p>\"Poor angel's gone down more than a Titanic hooker.\" - Kyrin, 2025</p><p>\"Technically, you could all get into my hole!\" - also Kyrin</p><p>We get hit by an <strong>Arcane Bombardment</strong>. I'm out of range; everyone saves except Fearghas who takes full damage. Ezeriel faints again. Kyrin whips out the <strong>Portable Hole</strong> with the intent to shove Ezeriel in. I'm getting frustrated with this angel; I take off my ward and channel <strong>Heal</strong>, heightened to 9th-level. He gets up from death's door with a few bruises and he can fly again as his wings are healed. Kyrin gives me a flat look. Fearghas is shouting to just GET IN THE HOLE. Emilio is still dangling 70 feet in the air, choked by the Horned Devil.</p><p>I should have jumped into the hole. I was too worried I'd need to heal someone, and would not be able to reach them from inside the hole! Plex fails the coinflip a 5th time. It takes Shalkoc's inspiration and a 6th coinflip for Plex to FINALLY have Arcane Gate prepared. Turns out Emilio can easily escape the Horned Devil whenever he wants, but he stayed grappled because he wanted to fight it.</p><p>Fearghas casts <strong>Dimension Door</strong>, Plex casts <strong>Arcane Gate</strong> and duplicates it with <strong>Fishy Magic</strong>. Passing through the string of portals, Fearghas arrives before Heaven's Gate and bangs on the door screaming LET US IIIIIN. A Narzugon crits Aviana, very bad idea that. She is also fighting with 2 Bone Devils. A third one joins the party! Emilio lands another crit with Reaping Claws, only to eat another <strong>Punishing Sting</strong>. Emilio pops 3 shards on <strong>Accrued Vitality</strong>, gaining 20 temp HP. For 2 more shards he uses <strong>Phase</strong> <strong>Shift</strong> and teleports right into the portal. He does fall 40 feet but his temp HP absorbs the damage.</p><p>Aviana stares down the devils, says \"Alright it's time for me to goooooo!\" and feeds a rage to her <strong>Royal Commander's Cloak</strong> to escape from the grapple. She walks away dragging the Narzugon, but gets an opportunity attack from a Bone Devil and immediately gets grappled again. She feeds the cloak another rage. This whole thing happens one more time. Aviana jumps into the hole, bringing the Narzugon, but she is wearing the Transdimensional Chain around her wrist, and it can't be contained in an extradimensional space right, so she gets stuck with her face in the hole and her bum sticking out.</p><p>Fearghas is having a fit yelling at Aviana to GET INTO THE PORTAL!! She does so, STILL bringing the devil and his burning horse. I get burned by a Horned Devil. Ezeriel stands up and tells us to go through the portal, that he will hold them back. We yell at him to go through, and open those gates for us! He goes through the portals, shouts to let us in, his friends recognise him and agree. Ezeriel runs the FCK back through the portals. We shout at him again, and ask him to protect the goblin who is holding the portaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaals!! Thankfully, he does that. Surprisingly, Shalkoc did a good amount of the yelling and he even sounded reasonable!</p><p>I get hit full force by the next Arcane Bombardment, while Kyrin dodges it perfectly. It burns, I'm fine, trust me, I'm okay, I promise. Kyrin picks up her hole and hurries through the portal. I follow right behind her. Plex and Ezeriel follow from the middle, and we all gather in front of Heaven's Gate. Behind us is a whole ARMY of devils. <strong>Planetars</strong> descend from the walls and pick us up, accompanied by DUMBO THE FLYING ELEPHANT who gives us an Aura of Invincibility, protecting us from a massive <strong>Fireball</strong>.</p><p>Aviana is still lugging the Narzugon, and the Planetars tear him apart. Guess Aviana will bother Fearghas for a goat plushie to hug now? She tries to grab a handful of the Nightmare's mane \"to add to the fashion\" but to her disappointment, the horse disappears when its summoner is slain. We are put down safely and approached by an <strong>Archon</strong> guard carrying a big tome. He says he needs to register us before sending us to the healers' ward. Ezeriel thanks us for saving him, and that seeing us alive is the only reward he wants for doing his duty.</p><p>The Archon reads us seven commandments:</p><p><em>Thou shalt not speak a lie.</em></p><p><em>Thou shalt not harm the innocent.</em></p><p><em>Thou shalt not desecrate that which is holy.</em></p><p><em>Thou shalt not place thyself above the greater good.</em></p><p><em>Thou shalt not abandon thy lawful duty.</em></p><p><em>Thou shalt not deny aid to those in need.</em></p><p><em>Thou shalt not deny a righteous plea for mercy.</em></p><p>Thankfully we still have the telepathic connection so we can discretely get our stories straight. <s>White Tower bullshit.</s> On the way to registration, Fearghas tells us why again they have got involved with Hell in the first place. This story told at the speed of thought is a real treat.</p>"

So naturally Fearghas googles the 3rd level of Heaven; we learn it's called Venya, a layer of snowy mountains and cities snug in valleys. It can only be reached by a path we must never stray from, and it's very lacking in defences. Nobody expects <s>the Spanish Inquisition</s> an attack on this level...</p><p>Aviana buys chocolate for the angels and we speak to the Elder of Promise.</p><p>The next evening, Frost Giants appear! Plex scrambles looking for alcohol, in case a party were to happen. We meet with General Ragvond who is sent by Utgard-Loki to establish trade with Promise. He also asks us, mainly Aviana really, for help in the war against Fire Giants. They are enslaving elementals which is very bad, such reprehensible behaviour, who would do such a thing. We agree we will help when we can, not right now.</p><p>Aviana receives the most massive anchor and chain known to the Multiverse, and plants the anchor down near the town. The chain, if dragged by someone of superhuman strength, will tear through reality to reunite with the anchor. If only we had a very strong harpy... oh but wait!</p><p>After some falling on our bums, some spooking Ragvond, and a healthy amount of joking around, Ragvond asks where the beer is, as this is Promise's trade good with the giants. We drink and party with the giants, who complain about being scammed and served water when Shalkoc is nearby.</p><p>Our Sunday morning begins with Fearghas grumbling at alchemy, and me yelling my lungs out at Shalkoc, who defuses the situation with cookies. I'll get him next time! We teleport to Heaven's Shore and arrive in the middle of a huge battle, a devil army is invading and a host of angels hurries to protect us. Only one survives, a gentleman called Ezeriel. We proceed to fight with him, and sometimes for him as he is knocked unconscious by the devils a significant amount. Some notable events in the battle:</p><ul><li><p>I grow tired of Ezeriel passing out and cast Heal at 9th level<sup>TM</sup></p></li><li><p>Kyrin shoots the Arrow of Destiny on a Bone Devil, even he is surprised that one arrow can hurt this bad</p></li><li><p>Fearghas fries Merregons like it's BBQ day</p></li><li><p>Aviana is the damsel in distress, still charges like a moose forward and back, and then forward and back</p></li><li><p>Time magic, and confusion</p></li><li><p>It starts to bucket down, wild magic eh</p></li><li><p>Shalkoc casually asks if anybody knows Shaik, we yell at Shalkoc</p></li><li><p>We all worry when Emilio is grappled by a Horned Devil and dangled 70 feet in the air, but he says he can teleport out at any time and just wants to <s>aura farm</s> fight him</p></li><li><p>Plex is the voice of reason</p></li><li><p>Plex is the voice of <strong>REASON</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>PLEX IS THE VOICE OF REASON</strong></p></li></ul><p>Divine light smites us when we attack unprovoked, which is funny when one devil gets a surge that blasts necrotic damage on everyone nearby. He heals the damage inflicted, then a beam of light descends on him and deal pretty much the damage he just healed. Aerelia kills my dog, again. Fearghas insults devils so bad they cry. Emilio throws the cute little stars on his cat-eared hoodie and OH GOD IT'S MAGIC MISSILES AND HE ROLLED MAX ON DAMAGE. Aviana leaves the little child (Kyrin in disguise) alone with the Bone Devil, then goes away to tank 3-4 devils like she fears we will steal them.</p><p>\"Shalkoc, you are good at two things. <strong>Healing is not one of them</strong>.\"</p><p>Shalkoc then proceeds to execute a shinobi technique of fingers up the arse on a Bone Devil. Kyrin casually pulls out the <strong>Sun Blade</strong> and slaps a crit on the Bone Devil, jumping down from the tree and lopping its head off. In its last moments, the Bone Devil hears the trees speaking Changeling, he is scarred for life. All this time Plex is frantically searching his spell book for the ONE SPELL that will save us from certain death. He loses the 50/50 <strong>FIVE</strong> times in a row, please don't ever play gacha games.</p><p>Kyrin wants everyone to get in her hole so she can pick it up and carry us to safety. We are shit at following simple instructions, and Plex finds his spell, so we instead make a daisy chain of portals and teleport to Heaven's Gate, where Fearghas bangs at the door screaming LET US IIIIIIN!! Emilio and Aviana escape their devil pursuers by fluttering a cloak, and doing a shady teleport. Not in that order. Shalkoc yelled at Ezeriel, very convincing, he must have learnt from the best.</p><p>At last the angels rescue us and fly us over the wall, where we are given 7 commandments which leave a decent amount of wriggle room, and we are told to go register ourselves. They are not super impressed by Aviana's chocolate. Fearghas tells us a very good story.</p>"

          "content": "<p><strong>Sunday 3</strong><sup><strong>rd</strong></sup><strong> Decimus, 1497</strong></p><p><strong>10:30</strong></p><p>We are taken to the registration hall by an angel called <strong>Verita</strong>. Close to the gates, an enormous white building with blue roofs is called the <strong>Administratorum</strong>. Ezeriel tells Verita of our heroic gates, and me saving his life! Verita says she will inform the <strong>Witnesses</strong>; citizens of Heaven randomly chosen for jury duty. We enter a large square room furnished with benches, and a small fountain in the middle of the room. We are instructed to wait, and we will be called individually through the ebony doors at one end of the room.</p><p>As we wait, another angel comes to offer water and fresh fruit and asks if we need immediate medical attention. We say we can wait, and we are left to our own devices. Fearghas prestidigidates water into blackcurrant and banana water for him and Plex, respectively. Aviana desires water with the flavour of \"whipped cream, strawberry and banana, with a tint of coffee and crushed pistage nuts\". Plex tries to hide. We tell him off. I tell Aviana we are not here to fight; it seems it was necessary.</p><p>After a short wait, I am called in first. The door shuts off telepathy spells; at the centre of the room, a pedestal magicked with <strong>Comprehend Languages</strong> bears the Seven Commandments. On each side of the room, three blindfolded Witnesses, citizens of Heaven, stand to aid Verita in her judgement. Depending on the entrant's answers to the mandatory and optional questions, they are to be provided with one of <strong>5 levels of guidance</strong> to ensure everyone's safety; the first being complete trust, the last constant surveillance by several archons.</p><p>I answer the questions to the best of my ability. There is kind of a lie already, not outright, but far from the full truth. It'll be fine I'm sure but I'm sweating through my dress. The Witnesses seem convinced by my answers? It's difficult to tell on smooth-faced blindfolded angels… They deem I don't need guidance and <strong>can find my own path</strong>. Phew. I have <strong>level 1</strong> guidance.</p><p>Fearghas goes after me. One of the Witnesses asks him why he seeks <strong>Torag</strong>. Our dwarf says \"reassurance\", as he followed Torag's teachings his whole life. He is also asked whether he has made bargains with the <strong>Void</strong>, Fearghas says no. Upon being asked, he says he seeks to help others. The players take turns playing the Witnesses, and Domi is incredible as a pompous angel. Fearghas is deemed to need <strong>level 2</strong> guidance.</p><p>Kyrin is called in. She immediately gives a false name, but without lying. (\"My current name is Miri Flick.\") Verita can see Kyrin's real shape, and asks for her <strong>true name</strong>. Kyrin gives it, and explains she is a <strong>shapeshifter</strong>. I ask if she intends to use her abilities for deception. She says she has in the past, as needed for her jobs, but she is not planning to deceive anyone here. Verita chimes in, asking if she wants to revise this statement. She says no, it was honest. Domi's Witness asks if Kyrin is acting as a proxy for evil itself. Kyrin dodges the question. The Witness asks, \"did you ever find justification for cruelty?\" Kyrin says she doesn't want to harm others if she can help it. Kyrin ends up with <strong>level 3</strong> guidance, calls us racists out of character.</p><p>Emilio sees an exasperated Kyrin come out, and he goes in. He says he hopes to gain better understanding of <strong>good and evil</strong>, and that he hasn't betrayed anyone. Verita asks him if he wishes to seek healing for the \"<strong>disfigurement</strong>\" he carries. He says he would rather not, as it is useful for now, but the offer is tempting. Karnack's Witness asks for clarification. Emilio is asked how he spent his earlier years, and he answers truthfully, though not mentioning the <strong>Void</strong> by name. I ask Emilio if, should the greater good require it, he would sacrifice his personal interests, he says yes. He gets <strong>level 2</strong> guidance.</p><p>Kyrin gives him The Look<sup>TM</sup> of \"did they grill you as much as they grilled me?\". Shalkoc goes in next. Oh, lord. When being asked why he seeks to enter Heaven's Shore, he hesitates and says \"I think I am going with a friend, <strong>I forgot</strong> why we're here, by the way the food here is amazing!\". Verita warns him to follow the commandments or suffer the consequences. Shalkoc reiterates he comes here with a friend to visit Heaven. He asks how to get an invitation to higher layers, gets told off. I ask if we can be certain he will remember the rules. He claims he is great at remembering rules because… aaaaah… he forgot. He is asked <strong>which other places</strong> he visited. \"The cold place, the cold place, the dark place… the city where one of my friends grew up…\" He gets asked to elaborate. \"The place where the frost giants and the fire giants are.\" Aight. Upon being asked whether he acts as a proxy for evil itself, he says \"I think I have my own will!\" Then, he says no. I ask if he requires \"healing for his mind\". He claims his friends guide him. We ask what if he is without his friends. He asks for a copy of the rules to take with him.</p><p>Shalkoc asks a question to himself. The table loses it. \"Snar for president!\" - Kyrin</p><p>\"Does that mean you do not <strong>remember</strong> whether you have done evil before?\" All the Witnesses are losing brain cells listening to Shalkoc. Verita says Shalkoc has told a minor lie; claiming he forgot why he sought entrance to Heaven's Shore. He justifies himself saying he was distracted and stressed out.</p><p>Shalkoc votes for himself. We lose our shit. Again.</p><p>Shalkoc gets a guidance of <strong>level 5</strong>. He asks if that is a good score. Verita explains he will have several angels accompanying him. Our dragonborn says that's great and asks if Ezeriel can accompany him. Shalkoc PROUDLY walks out of the room saying he got the highest score. Fearghas facepalms with the sound of falling pipes and prays to Torag. He receives a divine <strong>Bless</strong>.</p><p>Aviana goes in. She <strong>flexes</strong> as she says her full name. She says she wants to enter Heaven's Shore because she believes this is where true good resides. Also we were chased by an army of devils. She flexes, says she is doing this for a dwarf friend who keeps asking, but she doesn't mind because it makes her stronger. That is the full truth. Aviana says she didn't come for personal gain, but to help her friends and improve the circumstances of her tribe. Then she starts rambling about <strong>Promise</strong>. She admits she does not deeply understand the rules, but she is willing to learn, and will do her utmost to not forget them. That's better than the dragonborn… \"I will always attempt to <strong>grab</strong> onto the closest people who are in need of mercy, and hopefully I can deliver them graceful embrace in their time of need.\" She says evil must be defeated; but faced with the choice of smiting evil or helping the innocent, she would choose the latter. Aviana says by helping herself, she will also help others, because just look at these muscles. We're blindfolded. She says her mind is her greatest weakness, and she is trying to improve her problem with economics. Aviana gets <strong>level 2</strong> guidance, and flexes her way out.</p><p>Aviana is disappointed she didn't get as high a score as Shalkoc. I whisper to her it works the other way. Last but not least, Plex goes in. He claims he is <strong>cursed</strong> to tag along with the party, and since he is forced to follow them, he decides to help them. Karnack's Witness asks about the nature of Plex' curse, and whether it poses a danger to anyone else. Plex says it might have been a Hag, and affected the other goblins of his tribe, who are probably in great danger. He seeks nothing from Heaven itself, but enjoys the protection from the party. He would accept help with his curse. He offers to help the denizens of Heaven in exchange for help with his curse. Upon being asked, he says if one of his companions were to do an evil deed, that person should be punished. Domi's Witness asks if Plex has hurt people before, and if yes, has he enjoyed it (not in these terms). Plex says self-defence is not evil. I ask Plex why he is not helping his tribe. He says he is trying to find a way to suppress the curse, but it's a long process. Plex asks for <strong>clarification</strong> on the rules, and explanation of certain words.</p><p>Karnack's Witness asks \"Do you wash your rice before you cook it?\" Plex answers \"You're supposed to <em>cook</em> it?\" Plex gets <strong>level 3</strong> guidance.</p><p>Eventually the party is reunited. We discuss our results, and give Shalkoc shit. Fearghas casts <strong>Rary's Telepathic Bond</strong>, and then Plex runs back into the interrogation room, cutting himself off from the telepathic link. He asks if anyone is listening in on us. Verita asks him if he has anything to hide. Now she is more suspicious of Plex. Moments later, Verita leads us to another room where Ezeriel is waiting for us. He is glad to see us again. We are to go to the infirmary with him, and then we will meet Shalkoc's <s>bodyguards</s> guides.</p><p>Aerelia chokes on carrots again, despite his efforts to break this particular curse.</p><p>Aviana asks Ezeriel where the angels get their <strong>clothes</strong>. He is confused; he just buys them in the city. There is trade between Heaven's Shore and other planes, using gold as currency. Shalkoc asks if there is any place to buy herbs. Ezeriel grows sad, one of his companions, <strong>Solara</strong>, went to the herb store a lot. We cross a bridge lined by giant statues and get to the infirmary. It's more like a massive hospital, shining white walls and tall windows. A lot of people fly in and out of the place. We discuss the healing arts, and Ezeriel is disappointed by Aviana's comments. Fearghas warns him that he will have to revise his judgement of her many times.</p><p>Over the course of <strong>3 hours</strong>, we get treated and healed to full! <s>My max HP is still reduced, though.</s> A messenger comes in and asks to speak to Ezeriel in private. One of the angels asks Fearghas what troubles him. He replies \"How long you got?\". The angel says \"As long as it takes.\" With a glare towards Plex, Fearghas begins to unload all his frustration with Aviana and Plex. And goats. He rants about Shalkoc. He rants about the king of Lessia. He vents about his parents being imprisoned. He rages about the Drow and the Duergar. \"Thanks,\" Fearghas says, \"I think I needed that.\" The angel, <strong>Valeriel</strong>, says it's all good, it's a difficult burden to bear. + inspirational quote.</p><p>Plex walks around and explores, but gets told off when he is nosy. A celestial named <strong>Caelus</strong> asks Emilio to remove his bandages. Emilio hesitates, but does it. Caelus seems sad, but tries to comfort Emilio about scars being a source of pride, and part of who he is. Someone tries to heal my channelling fatigue, it does not work. The head of this wing, <strong>Clementiel</strong>, comes in to have a look. He seems young, but I sense he is wise and tired. He recognises my fatigue for what it is, burning my life force to heal others, and he scolds me. I thank him… He then says he recognises my staff, and says… \"Thank you.\"</p><p>Natural 20 on emotional damage. The FEELS. My little heart. Yeah I sat here with my hands at my heart, eyes misty, for a moment Naami and Pebble were the same person.</p><p>Aviana is advised to take better care of her feathers, or she will lose the ability to fly. She says she can't fly, and it's not a bug, it's a feature. The angel says, normally harpies <em>can</em> fly? \"These wings aren't for flight, they are made to solidify my charismatic appearance,\" Aviana says. She asks to learn more about her race, where <strong>harpies</strong> come from, and how to make her wings harder and bigger like her BICEPS. Because \"everybody knows size matters,\" she says as she looks at Fearghas.</p><p>Plex and Ezeriel return as we are chilling by a fountain. The angel looks really disheartened; he says he is not allowed to return to the front lines for 2 months, so he may take time to grieve for his squad. He wants to go back and fight, but accepts his fate and quotes words the Marshal Shaik said to him when he first arrived in Heaven. Plex asks if we can honour the dead with Ezeriel; they sacrificed themselves to save us. Fearghas agrees with Plex, which deeply annoys him. We get invited to the funeral for Ezeriel's squad on the second layer, but we need to ask the Marshal Shaik first (the very angel Shalkoc is contracted to kill).</p><p>3 <strong>Devas</strong> arrive and introduce themselves as <strong>Huey, Dewey, and Louie</strong>. They're not their real names, but they chose these nicknames to help Shalkoc remember them. Shalkoc says 6 is the double of 5 and we all have to roll an INT save. We get a splitting headache and Plex, who rolled a natural 1, gets a bout of <strong>madness</strong> that manifests in the overwhelming urge to eat something strange such as dirt. He takes out a piece of jade from his pack and starts nibbling on it. I try to get him to spit it out, but he swallows the stone and proudly shows his empty mouth. Aviana wants to go to the library and have someone read her bedtime stories about \"the glorious harpy race\". Huey, Dewey, and Louie cannot help with that, they have to watch Shalkoc at all times. The moment a library is mentioned, we lose Fearghas, as expected. Aviana claims to be an intellectual. Kyrin says we're not supposed to lie. The harpy defends herself. Nobody believes her.</p><p>Plex tries to make sense of Fearghas' magic, shows a beautiful picture in his spellbook. Fearghas cannot make heads nor tails of it. Plex learns the spell <strong>Planetrotting</strong>! The material component is hilarious, it's like he tried to figure out <strong>Plane Shift</strong>, got most of the way there, and got there by Plex means. We head to the armoury to take Shalkoc's toys away. He has to surrender all his magic items, but is allowed to keep his <strong>Snack Pack</strong>. Kyrin pats him on the shoulder. Shalkoc is told to put all his magic items and weapons into a chest, but there is a tiny problem; he has 2 <strong>cursed items</strong> (the <strong>Draconic Amulet of Greed</strong> and the <strong>Bracers of Asmodeus</strong>) he refuses to take off. We tell him to be reasonable, but he protests. Fearghas smells the bullshit by virtue of a natural 20 on <strong>Insight</strong>. \"Right folks, hold 'im down, dogpile!\" Kyrin goes to sneak the Amulet off of him, but one of the guards notices and tells her off for stealing.</p><p>I sigh and cast <strong>Remove Curse</strong> on Shalkoc. Both his curses are broken, he feels a lot less greedy. He hands over his magic items and poisons with no further fuss, keeping basically only his Snack Pack. Aviana wants to trade feathers with the Devas. They are confused but see no harm in it. Ezeriel gives her a feather, and Aviana returns the favour.</p><p>With our obligations taken care of, and three days until the funeral, we decide to go shopping. Plex wants to jump on clouds, is disappointed. He wants to eat a cloud instead. The madness has passed, this is just Plex. Aviana says he needs to learn the spell <strong>Eat Cloud</strong>. Fearghas has no idea what she is going on about.</p><p>Before the all-important shopping, we decide to go see Shaik to ask for passage to the 2nd layer. Telepathically, Fearghas confirms we should speak to Shaik about the contract, since we are not sworn to silence on <em>this</em> one. As we walk, Kyrin asks the Deva guards if they have ever fought a <strong>Sibriex</strong>; she mentions the <strong>Perfected Deva</strong> I released from its agony. They know what it is, and upon hearing that story, they kneel down and pray in sorrow. I join them, hoping I have the right. They wish he hadn't had to suffer through this, but they're glad we could put an end to that madness. They ask Shalkoc if he remembers this fight.</p><p>Snar: Which fight?</p><p>Aerelia, quietly: My man…</p><p>Shalkoc remembers, thankfully. The Devas send a message asking for more assistance because they did not realise how strong a warrior Shalkoc is. It's in case he needs more \"physical guidance\". 2 <strong>Planetars</strong> arrive; <strong>Laurel and Hardy</strong>. We reach Shaik's office palace and are greeted by more Planetar guards. After a short wait, Shaik comes out to meet us. She is a dark-skinned, curly-haired woman with amber eyes and golden wings. She dismisses the guards and welcomes us. Ezeriel explains we wish for permission to attend the burial ceremony for his squad. \"So you're the people Solara and the others sacrificed themselves for. I'm glad to see you alive.\" She asks what brought us here. Aviana urges Shalkoc to give Shaik chocolate. She accepts it and says it's very kind, but it would be a greater present to someone who might be hungry, or might never had chocolate before.</p><p>Fearghas asks Emilio if he ever had chocolate before. He has, but only likes the sweeter varieties.</p><p>Fearghas explains to Shaik about <strong>Shalkoc's contract</strong> to kill her. As soon as he drops Zariel's name, Shaik looks sad… \"Another poor soul,\" she says. Fearghas says we only took the contract to save Plex' life. She says she is proud of us for speaking out, and standing against evil. We chose good despite there being no reward for it, and we should be proud of ourselves. Kyrin asks if there is a way out of Shalkoc's contract. Shaik says no, it's a lawful contract and it will not be broken. She tells of being in denial after <strong>Zariel</strong>'s fall; she went to Asmodeus to bargain for Zariel's soul back. Asmodeus told her that Zariel had chosen her path. If a devil can own your soul, they can also sell it. It requires a legal contract, but that is the only way to get a soul back from a devil. We wonder what Zariel would want so much that she would trade Shalkoc's dragon soul for it… Fearghas suggests, very carefully, the threat of an <strong>invasion</strong> from Heaven. Preferrably on <strong>Dis</strong>, so Zariel gets shit from <strong>Dispater</strong> AND <strong>Asmodeus</strong>!</p><p>We consider killing Zariel somehow, and discuss the consequences for our souls. Technically, Zariel originates from Heaven, not Hell, so the only way to destroy her is to kill her in Heaven…</p><p>We conclude that we need to coerce Zariel to sell Shalkoc's soul back to him, and Kyrin's soul back to her. We ask Shaik for advice on how to get to the 3rd layer. She muses that <strong>an act of great craftsmanship</strong> could get us invited to Torag's realm, or maybe <strong>big dwarven heroics</strong>! Shalkoc asks Shaik \"Where do angels cry?\" Because angel tears can help people? He asks if people are going to cry at the funeral. Shaik's face goes to stone and she says you will not find angel tears in Heaven. You will have to go to the depths of Hell, where celestials are endlessly tortured in <strong>Mephistopheles</strong>' dungeons. That is what <strong>Silver Tears</strong> are.</p><p>I did not know… I did not know what Silver Tears were. Light forgive me. I did not know… The floor seems to shift under my feet, I clench my fists. My head burns. Do not fall and cry. There is nothing I can do now. But I know the truth.</p><p>Fearghas' idea:</p><ul><li><p>Get to Dis (either through the <strong>Bronze Citadel</strong>, the <strong>Black Vents</strong>, or the <strong>River Styx</strong>).</p></li><li><p>Threaten Zariel to use the <strong>Beacon of Doom</strong> in Dis and let Heaven invade.</p></li></ul><p>It's a dangerous plan relying on Zariel being complacent, Kyrin having been in Hell as her innocent-looking child form Miri.</p><p>Emilio wants to take part in threatening Zariel, so Fearghas asks if he has any means of coming back from the dead, just as a precaution. He does not, and can't carry Aviana's <strong>Hearthstone </strong>(too heavy). We plan on going to the Black Vents to at least figure out what is going on there. Whatever is there scares (?) Zariel, so we are interested.</p>"

          "content": "<h1>The angelic tribunal of meet &amp; greet</h1>\n<p>Fearghas makes water taste better. We are called one by one to stand before <strong>Verita</strong> and six Witnesses who determine how much <del>helicopter parenting</del> guidance we need to not burn down the place. When one of us is called in, the others play as the angelic Witnesses, friendliest PvP I have ever seen.</p>\n<p>I am called in first, squeak a bit and sweat a lot, get the lowest level of guidance. Fearghas goes next and speaks about <strong>Torag</strong>, he is asked about the <strong>Void</strong> for some reason. He makes it out with level 2 guidance, basically just needs to catch up with an archon every few days, hopefully over tea and crumpets. Kyrin follows, she speaks honestly but the angels aren't fond of a roguish background. She gets out with level 3 guidance muttering about racist, what does racing have to do with all this…?</p>\n<p>We all sweat when Emilio goes in. Verita asks if he wants his hands healed. Emilio says they're pretty useful. Upon being asked he speaks about his childhood but never mentions the <strong>Void</strong> by name. Technically not lying. He shows his best side and gets level 2 guidance, we all exhale. None of us are prepared for what follows.</p>\n<p>Shalkoc goes in, says he forgot why he came here and talks about the food. Verita says that's a lie; not the food part, the forgetting part. He is great at remembering rules! Why? He forgot. Shalkoc visited many places: the cold place, the hot place, the dark place, the city where a friend grew up. The angels are bamboozled and gently ask if he is delayed in French and needs his mind healed. He declines, then asks a question to <strong>himself</strong>. The Witnesses are losing brain cells. Sheer chaos at the table. Shalkoc votes for himself. \"Snar for president!\" - Kyrin</p>\n<p>Shalkoc is very proud of his level 5 guidance. Highest score. Fearghas facepalms so hard, Torag hears his desperate prayers. Aviana tries to emulate Shalkoc's high score, thankfully fails. She rambles a bit and <strong>flexes</strong>, sadly no effect on the blindfolded Witnesses. She gets level 2. We nearly forget about Plex, he was trying to be forgotten. He speaks about his <strong>curse</strong>, and says evildoers should be punished. Our good goblin asks clarification on the rules. Then Witness F asks the all-important question, \"Do you wash your rice before you cook it?\" and Plex replies \"You're supposed to <em>cook</em> it?\" That alone earns him level 3 guidance. We discuss our results, Plex nearly screws us over, and we head to the infirmary.</p>\n<p>Aerelia chokes on carrots again, despite his efforts to break this particular curse. He was so close, only one carrot remained, but no, he was defeated by the penultimate orange root.</p>\n<p>We chat with Ezeriel on the way, then spend 3 hours at the hospital having our wounds treated. Fearghas has a therapy session with nurse <strong>Valeriel</strong>. Plex gets told off for being nosy. Nurse <strong>Caelus</strong> looks at Emilio's hands and gives him a comforting talk. The head doctor <strong>Clementiel</strong> scolds me for channelling, advises me to heal more sustainably. As he turns to leave, he says \"I recognise that staff you are carrying… Thank you.\"</p>\n<p>Natural 20 on emotional damage.</p>\n<p>Aviana is told to take better care of her wings, and has a conversation about the glorious <strong>harpy</strong> race. We meet Shalkoc's bodyguards <strong>Huey, Dewey, and Louie</strong> (nicknames Shalkoc can remember). Shalkoc says 6 is the double of 5, which causes psychic damage and Plex eats a rock out of sheer madness. Plex learns the spell Planetrotting, by doodling and thinking hard about Plane Shift. We go to the armoury to take away Shalkoc's toys, I cast a Remove Curse on him so he can unequip his cursed items without us all dogpiling on him. The angels realise Shalkoc is a lot stronger than they thought, so they call in 2 more powerful bodyguards, <strong>Laurel and Hardy</strong>.</p>\n<p>We go see Shaik to request permission to attend the <strong>funeral</strong> for Ezeriel's squad, they all died to protect us after all. We tell her about the contract to kill her. She is saddened, we talk about Zariel and hatch a crazy plan…</p>\n<p>Instead of using the <del>strawberry field</del> <strong>Beacon of Doom</strong> in Heaven, we go to <strong>Dis</strong> and threaten to use it there so the angels can invade. This will be our bargaining chip to <strong>buy</strong> back Shalkoc and Kyrin's souls from Zariel. Emilio loves the plan and wants to screw over Zariel personally. Do not see how any of this could possibly go wrong.</p>"

          "content": "<p><strong>Sunday, 3</strong><sup><strong>rd</strong></sup><strong> Decimus 1497</strong></p><p><strong>23:45</strong></p><p>Shaik encourages us to talk about anything burdening our hearts. Fearghas explains his cunning plan to threaten to invade Hell, and asks for Shaik's support. We discuss what we do if Zariel doesn't agree to sell the souls back, so Fearghas mentions a possible <strong>Wish</strong> spell. Wish can go terribly wrong, and Fearghas mentions an <strong>Aeon</strong> that could undo a Wish. I have no idea what he is talking about, but Shaik grows very stern and asks how much he really knows about those creatures. Fearghas admits, not much. Shaik says, it would be better to keep it that way. Well that's ominous.</p><p>Shaik is unwilling to commit time and troops to threatening Zariel, especially since the plan could fail. Kyrin's contract is already failed, as she telepathically told Shaik about it. Shaik warns us to be VERY careful that <strong>Dispater</strong> does not learn of our plan. He is very paranoid, and any form of magical spying will be considerably more difficult. Shaik says that getting into Dis by sailing the <strong>River of Souls</strong> is not <em>just</em> a bad idea, it's a lot worse. <s>Not to mention we'd have to be dead</s>. We mention the <strong>Black Vents</strong>; Shaik questions the reliability of our intel. Don't blame her, this idea comes from Aviana overhearing devils chat about it… She also urges us to be super careful about it, research and scout.</p><p>Kyrin asks Shaik for help drafting another contract to reclaim her soul and Shalkoc's. She suggests we go to <strong>Mechanus</strong> to ask help from the <strong>Modrons</strong>, or any servant of <strong>Abadar</strong>. Plex casually says <strong>Mennon</strong> can probably write a good contract. Yes, the Archfey, the Unseelie Fey Lord. He can find all the loopholes, right? Fearghas vetoes, then drags his feet in telling Shaik about Mennon but eventually explains. Mennon is Plex' lord, and he was on a hunt for dragons and placed a mark on Shalkoc's soul.</p><p>Shaik says the Bronze Lady could help us; <strong>Brigh</strong>, goddess of clockword, invention, and timekeeping. Another reason to go to Mechanus? Her realm alone could inspire us. We should talk to <strong>Claude </strong>in the Library first, get papers in order, then go to <strong>Axis</strong>. Talking to Abadar's servants would also provide more information.</p><p>Do we have any more questions? I have so many questions. Can I do an internship here? Shaik speaks to me about life and death, and that my soul might belong on this plane? I prefer to live in the here and now. Shaik gives us permission to walk the <strong>Pilgrim's Path</strong> so we may attend the memorial for Ezeriel's squad. She also asks that we keep her updated. With final advice on being patient, and taking time to prepare, she lets us be on our way. In Heaven, we are as safe as we can be.</p><p>On our way back to the City, Ezeriel asks for a <strong>token</strong> from each of us (feather, scale, lock of hair…). Fearghas asks why, Ezeriel sort of dodges the question and only says it's important to him, and to history. \"You'll see,\" he says. Plex asks for a token back, and Ezeriel offers a feather. Plex gives a piece of toenail. Emilio breaks a chip off his hand, it grows back, not creepy at all. Kyrin and me give a lock of hair. Fearghas gives a piece of beard. Shalkoc gives a scale and Aviana gives a feather, making a fuss.</p><p>Fearghas asks for <strong>hot springs</strong> nearby; Ezeriel says of course, there are the baths close to the infirmary. Baths! I'd love a good soak… Kyrin wants to go to an armourer for shopping. She is hoping to find armour for Aviana's wings that would allow her to fly. Jewelry would also be good! I mention it's the middle of the night, though the realm is bathed in twilight, and that maybe we should find a place to sleep. Fearghas asks for a place that sells spell scrolls, of course he does. Emilio seconds this? Ezeriel is confused; the spells aren't really for sale, more for teaching.</p><p>Aviana wants to buy a dress, and Plex wants holy robes. Ezeriel leaves, with the promise to see us on Wednesday for the memorial. Plex wants to hit the markets now in the middle of the night, grumbling about how on Promise, shops are closed at night. Aviana buys her dress for 15 gold. To learn a spell, you'd have to become an <strong>acolyte</strong> and commit to the angels' teachings. Fearghas is not willing to commit.</p><p>Kyrin spots a celestial from Nirvana who is painting his wings, with magic paint to not interfere with his ability to fly. Shalkoc struggles with himself, eyeing the paint like he wonders what it tastes like. Under Fearghas' withering glare, he keeps it together. The artistic angel, <strong>Ventriel</strong>, is a follower of <strong>Shaelyn</strong>, goddess of beauty and art. Plex introduces himself as Plex, follower of friends. The goblin is interested in the paint… Ventriel says he is an artist as well! Everybody is! Most people just don't know it yet! \"Don't encourage him,\" I squeak. Fearghas glares. The angel and the goblin engage in active artistic talk while Kyrin giggles.</p><p>\"Are you just trying to summon <strong>Smiler</strong> again?\" Fearghas asks, menacingly. Plex dodges the question and says he will be painting on buildings. Ventriel prompts Plex on what kind of art he is planning on, exactly. Plex is not planning on anything, he just wants paint. <s>Twelve pans of caint</s>. He happily pays 120 gold for it, struggles counting his coins, upsets the cosmic order in the process, just Plex things. Kyrin looks for something that would allow Aviana to change the <strong>colour</strong> of her wings, which Ventriel considers to be perfectly reasonable. You gotta match those outfits after all. He could make it, but it will take some time, so he offers to contact Kyrin when it is done. It would cost the pretty sum of 5000 gold, half upfront. Kyrin agrees immediately.</p><p>Emilio buys a <strong>black pearl</strong> for 500 gold. <s>Not a pirate ship</s>. Shalkoc is cartoon-floating, nose following the smell of sweets baking. Kyrin buys <strong>Olykoeks</strong> (donuts) for everyone, including Shalkoc's bodyguards. Plex gives her a <strong>Potion of Heroism</strong> in return, which reminds Fearghas to look for alchemy supplies, but he has <em>negative</em> luck.</p><p>After the delicious sweet snack, we go to the Library where we meet <strong>Claude</strong>, a mechanical cube with spindly arms and legs, and a pair of wings that are definitely too small to lift him off the ground? He wears a monocle, very distinguished. He takes simple requests. VERY simple requests. He has way too much information on Avernus, and nothing on the Black Vents. Fearghas intellectually wrestles with the robot, gets an estimated wait time of 12 hours. Grumble.</p><p>We go to an inn and pay 15 gold per person, per night. The food is amazing though. We lose Shalkoc for a couple hours, he's just sitting there unresponsive, then he begins to talk our ears off. By that time it's 2 in the morning and no one is listening.</p><hr><p><strong>Monday, 4</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> Decimus, 1497</strong></p><p><strong>10:00</strong></p><p><strong>Short rest</strong></p><p>When we arrive at the Library and check on Claude, he is struggling with the progress bar at 15%. Poor little guy, he just needs more time. Shalkoc and Aviana are dying to go to the baths and eat some tasty food. Plex tags along, then watches the sunset and sniffs his paint. Fearghas, Kyrin, and Emilio spend the whole day in the library, researching the old way. I accompany them at first but grow tired eventually, and head to the infirmary where I watch the nurses heal with innate magic, fascinated.</p><hr><p><strong>Tuesday, 5</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> Decimus, 1497</strong></p><p><strong>10:00</strong></p><p><strong>Short rest</strong></p><p>Plex wakes us in the mid-morning, saying he has something to show us. He hurries to the kitchen, where they kindly shoo him out. We gather in a private dining room and have a good breakfast, where Plex shows us a black <strong>lantern</strong>, glowing with a blue light. Shalkoc and Aviana, not fully awake, leave the room to get more food. Plex swings the lantern excitedly. Fearghas reaches for it, screaming NOOOOOOO! Just then, the world blurs and I feel the typical sensation of <strong>teleportation</strong>, like having my stomach pulled through my nose.</p><p>We find ourselves standing on a large circular stone in an eerie <strong>swamp</strong>. A blood-red moon hangs in the sky, glaring at us with cold spite. (<strong>Realm effect</strong>: Blood Moon's Spite)</p><p>\"Pleeeeeeeeeeex…\" Fearghas says ominously.</p><p>\"… oops?\" the goblin replies.</p><p>Emilio shudders. Fearghas scolds Plex, and says we must stick together. He says we are somewhere between the <strong>Feywild</strong> and the <strong>Shadowfell</strong>?! And that last time they were here, things started attacking them. Stay in the lantern's light. The blood moon is new, last time this place was pitch black… I grab Kyrin's hand while she questions Plex on where we are and why. He tells the story of when he first found the lantern. (Read: The Lantern in Plex' Memories)</p><p>Plex wants to paint a tree. We look around for blobs of colour, no luck. The moon is either a new moon or a blood moon, it only has 2 <strong>phases</strong>. This one is the opposite of what the one on the Material Plane is. Holding the lantern, Plex walks up to a tree (so we all follow him to stay in the light) and begins to paint it bright blue. The bark shrivels up violently as if the paint was acid.</p><p>We follow a path of sorts through the marsh, and come across two <strong>Spriggans</strong>, plant creatures that resemble the Leshen, only much smaller (phew). One of them is carrying an unconscious <strong>Dryad</strong>. He jumps off and walks away as the other Spriggan spots us. It starts shrieking; words that Plex recognises as very distorted <strong>Sylvan</strong>. He tries to talk to the Spriggan. It does not work out.</p><p>Fearghas says if we stray too far from the lantern, we will be teleported back to where we came from. Every plant is diseased and covered in <strong>mould</strong>. It's as moudly as some places in the Underdark! Except this mould looks more… aggressive, somehow. Fearghas chucks a <strong>Fire Bolt</strong> on the Spriggan, which is still screaming. I summon Fade and timidly follow after Fearghas. <s>I need a friend</s>. Plex hides so well, I have no idea where he is. Emilio steps in front of me and casts… <strong>HELLFIRE</strong>?! It's a CANTRIP?! It misses, so he goes into <strong>Void Form</strong> and activates <strong>Netherwalk</strong>. Fade walks up behind Emilio, and takes a defensive stance (the <strong>Dodge</strong> action).</p><p>Kyrin walks up to Fade, and shoots the Spriggan with her bow. It does not hit. The Spriggan's bark skin grows darker and sturdier, like oak. It steps into one fallen tree… and out of the one right behind me. It sees Plex, and attacks him. The Spriggan slashes with his claws, and poisons Plex badly, I can't heal him unless I use a <strong>Lesser Restoration</strong> first to cure the poison… Our goblin is severely injured.</p><p>Fearghas launches <strong>Scorching Rays</strong> at the Spriggan, it doesn't burn as well as it did just a minute ago. Shoot. Fearghas insults him as a bonus action (<strong>Vicious Mockery</strong>). I reach out to Plex with a <strong>Healing</strong> <strong>Word</strong> and… my magic doesn't take hold. His complexion improves, I imagine the poison is gone, but his wounds aren't closing! Panicked, I step forward to cast a spell, but my mind resists it. I'm already concentrating to maintain Fade in this world… I stumble away, reaching out for my staff and lashing out with a <strong>Lightning Bolt</strong>.</p><p>Plex casts <strong>Blight</strong> on the Spriggan, which immediately kills it. I rush over to Plex and start dressing his wounds but my hands shake and I do a very poor job of it. Emilio pokes the dead Spriggan and Fearghas picks up some <strong>Bloodroot</strong> at the foot of the tree. Kyrin looks for flowers… everything here is dead or dying and rotting.</p><p>According to Plex, Spriggans (and also the Leshen) look like fey creatures, but very twisted. We follow the path the other Spriggan took. Off in the distance, we see a large tree. Red fluid flows into the tree and we hear… singing. Very ominous words:</p><p><em>By the moon's blood light, we stand,</em></p><p><em>To corrupt this creature of the land.</em></p><p><em>The heart of the wood, so pure and bright,</em></p><p><em>Will blacken and break in endless night.</em></p><p>Four red platforms surround the tree. The Dryad's body hangs in mid-air in a bubble of blood and energy, and the creatures that are chanting are <strong>Blood Hags</strong>. They spot us immediately, except Kyrin who is one with the shadows. One of the Hags has a ladle with a handle so long, it's practically a staff. She grins at us with FAR too many teeth, all the while stirring the cauldron in front of her. The Hags sing the next verse:</p><p><em>With raven's claw and eye of newt,</em></p><p><em>We nurture now a bitter root.</em></p><p><em>Her skin of bark will twist and thorn,</em></p><p><em>A monster in this clearing born.</em></p><p>They taunt us as we approach. We roll initiative. One of the Blood Hags slips on blood, falls into her own cauldron screaming as she is boiled alive, and dies. How unfortunate! Just Plex things.</p><p>I trash talk the nearest Hag and get <strong>cursed</strong> for my trouble. BAD curse, I can't do shit except hope to the goddesses that I pass the save. (<strong>Sanguine Curse</strong>) She then shoots <strong>Blood Bolts</strong> at Emilio, who slaps her with <strong>Hellish Rebuke</strong>, twice.</p><p>I PASS THE SAVE ON THE FIRST TRY for the low low price of 8 necrotic damage and a concentration save. Aaaand one level of <strong>exhaustion</strong> from the Realm Effect. I move closer, thinking only of saving the Dryad… and right into the range of the Hag up north. She casts Spike Growth, catching us all in the area. Difficult terrain, damage on movement. Blehblehbleh. Fade <strong>dashes</strong> to the nearest Hag, fangs bared. Emilio goes into Void Form, and shoots 3 blasts. Kyrin is sneaky sneaky and only reveals herself to shoot the Hag, and <strong>Mark</strong> the soul. She chucks a Psychic Blade, sadly misses, moves behind the rock.</p><p>Plex casts a <strong>Gravity Sinkhole</strong> then Fey Steps into a tree. Further Plex things, really. Fearghas drinks a <strong>Potion of Maximum Power</strong> and casts Scorching Ray at 4th level. Emilio gets cursed, burns an inspiration to pass the save. He cackles at the Hag. Fearghas frowns, Emilio is going off the deep end. The Hag scowls, then sings the third verse of the ritual!</p><p><em>Willow's sap will cease to flow,</em></p><p><em>Bitter ichor we bestow.</em></p><p><em>With spider's silk and serpent's skin,</em></p><p><em>Let all the foulest rot begin.</em></p><p>She tosses the ladle into the stew, and blood surges out and towards the tree. The wood creaks, and one of the four openings in the trunk closes. The unconscious Dryad spasms in agony and it looks a lot like bloodbending?! The Hag comes close, insulting Emilio. He fights back with a spirited \"Try me!\". He gets hit with a <strong>Blood Bolt</strong>, is poisoned, and fails the save so he has to hurt a creature before the end of his next turn. He slaps a <strong>Hellish</strong> <strong>Rebuke</strong> on the Hag and once more, Aerelia is passing all the saves tonightaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.</p><p>The next Hag sings the fourth verse, then throws in the ladle, closing the south opening in the trunk!</p><p><em>The forest's plea, a mournful sound,</em></p><p><em>Is lost upon this blighted ground.</em></p><p><em>With sinner's spleen and powdered bone,</em></p><p><em>She'll rule a dark and twisted throne.</em></p><p>Fade bites at her and throws her down, but she shrugs it off and goes to taunt and attack Emilio. Plex casts Temporal Shunt in reaction, but the Hag passes the save. We yell at Aerelia a little bit. Emilio is injured pretty bad, and grappled. Then the Hag tries to <strong>PEEL</strong> OFF Emilio's face! He burns his last inspiration to make the save, grabbing her wrist to keep her hand off him. She lashes at him with her <strong>Blood-Drinking Hair</strong> but he saves, taking half damage. She heals for half the damage dealt!</p><p>Plex knows a thing or two about Hags… in the ritual he was involved in, there were 6 verses. We are running out of time!</p><p>Acting on instinct, I walk through the thorns and lay my hand on Emilio's back. \"I put my hope in you,\" I tell him, and summon my strength to cast <strong>Regenerate</strong>. I add a <strong>Healing Word</strong> heightened to second level. He grins with an air of madness as he flexes his claws. He does a <strong>Phase Shift</strong> to the other side of the blood cauldron, then casts Eldritch Blast and pulls the Hag into the cauldron with <strong>Grasp of Hadar</strong>. She screeches as she dies in the boiling crimson liquid. But Emilio gets a wild magic surge and is incapable to speak any language, making <strong>animal noises</strong> instead. He barks at her…</p><p>Fade dashes to the Hag that ran to the west to take the place of her fallen sister. Kyrin shoots at that Hag and <strong>Marks</strong> the Soul. She throws a Psychic Blade into the Hag. Plex, this beautiful bastard. Plex, of the deepest of greens. Plex, goblin of many hats. PLEX CASTS <strong>SILENCE</strong>! I'm going to hug him, but not so tight he loses concentration. Fearghas casts Misty Step then moves to the platform next to Emilio. He casts, at 6th level, <strong>Traitorous Blood</strong>. And <em>that</em>'s the bloodbending. \"It's just a little enchantment magic, don't worry about it.\" - Fearghas</p><p>Fearghas makes the Hag dash towards him and Emilio, who takes an attack of opportunity with <strong>Reaping Claws</strong> against her as she passes. The Hag's mouth is forced shut; her eyes are full of horror at being on the receiving end of unholy-ass magic. I question Fearghas on this magic, but now is not the time nor the place… I cast a <strong>Chill Touch</strong> <s>the bad touch</s> on the Hag in the area of Silence. She tries to leave it, Fade bites her and trips her. Go Fade! But then the Hag gets to her feet and jumps out of the Silence spell. We almost had her. She casts a <strong>Sanguine Curse</strong> on Fearghas, but he saves. Seeing Plex' lantern, she shoots him with Blood Bolts but he <strong>Temporal Shunts</strong> her all the way into her next turn.</p><p>Fade tiptoes to the spot where the Hag will soon reappear, goes invisible, and <strong>readies</strong> to bite. Emilio realises he can't speak human languages anymore; his face goes blank, he ignores Fearghas' warning and goes to slice the Hag he is controlling, then uses <strong>Bloodrazor</strong> and walks up to Fade, ready for the other Hag to reappear. Kyrin sneaks up to the same spot, then unsheathes her <strong>Sun Blade,</strong> so we all know where she is.</p><p>Plex does \"the obvious thing in this situation\", and builds a wall of dirt with <strong>Mold Earth</strong>. Fearghas readies <strong>Ray of Frost</strong>, and makes his Hag ready Blood Bolt. The Hag appears. Fade bites her, drops her prone. Kyrin stabs her, shiningly! Except she rolls a 1 and she rolls a 2, and even with advantage none of this hits, blinded by her own sword… Fearghas releases his Ray of Frost and his Hag casts Blood Bolt. I release my <strong>Guiding Bolt</strong>.</p><p>The Hag is extremely confused by all that just happened. She snarls, \"if we can't have her, you can't have her either!\" and runs into the tree cackling and casting three Blood Bolts. Fade rushes in and bites the Hag. Emilio runs right after Fade and casts <strong>Steel Wind Strike</strong> on the Hag who is lying prone, so he gets advantage. With the ROAR of a T-rex, Emilio teleports behind the Hag and slashes her, tendrils bursting from his claws. His gauntlets devour the body until only a puddle of blood is left. I feel Fade's unease… what in the world makes an undead panther feel uneasy…</p><p>Combat ends, so I can go and verify for myself, unfortunately. I run to the Dryad, ignoring all else. She has been torn to pieces and is beyond saving. I fall to my knees screaming in frustration and pain. More corruption I could not stop. More twisted, sick magic I was powerless against! Fearghas asks me, if the corpse was whole, could you do anything? I'm not even sure. Fearghas casts <strong>Grave Craft</strong> nine times to get the body back together; it moves unnaturally and it takes most of my remaining strength of mind to watch. I make myself watch. I owe it to her.</p><p>Fearghas crushes a spellgem of <strong>Revivify</strong> and brings the Dryad back to life. She's unconscious, but breathing. The ritual was almost complete… the Dryad is warped, proportions off, skin hardened to bark, any gentleness gone from her features, her teeth are pointed and sharp.</p><p>Emilio's Void Form ends and he collapses, groaning and muttering weakly. I drop to my knees next to him, twisting the spellwards off my wrists. I cast at 8th level, <strong>Remove Curse</strong>. Emilio weakly kicks me away and huddles in a corner whispering \"I'm sorry, it won't happen again, I promise, I didn't want to, I'm sorry, I did it again, never again, you mustn't know, I'm so sorry…\" Kyrin and Fearghas try to comfort him, and he only pulls away in fear.</p><p>Plex painted the Hag <strong>blue</strong> while nobody was looking; even Emilio chuckles at this. Fearghas interrogates her, with Plex casting <strong>Detect Thoughts</strong> on her. Her thoughts are of spite and glee… and a complete absence of fear. She asks Fearghas which crone taught him the bloodbending. \"That's none of yer business,\" he says. The Hag says, this is the art of \"<strong>the mother</strong>\". Fearghas asks who that is. \"The one-eyed, the queen of us, the goddess of fallen and destitute women. The goddess of spite, the angry hag. You come here, to her realm, and you don't even know the mother's name? You use her arts, and you don't even honour the mother's name?\" And then insults follow, I ain't writing that.</p><p>Fearghas makes her eat one of her own fingers. Emilio shakily gets up and attemps <strong>Intimidation</strong>. He rolls a 29. He squeezes her shoulder and threatens to show her \"true madness and fear\", worse than anything he has been through in 15 years. The Hag lashes out (verbally); \"what do YOU know of suffering\", no man shall show her suffering, it would all be child's play. What she experienced would break any man. \"It did break me, but I grew from it. I became the very monsters who broke me.\" Plex, reading the Hag's thoughts, sees irrational hatred and spite.</p><p>Fearghas asks the name of the <strong>one-eyed</strong>, what she is doing to the Feywild, and why. The Hag says she cannot say that to us, and grins. She says she can introduce Kyrin and us to her, we assume because we're <strong>women</strong>. Emilio lashes out in defence of us. The Hag taunts. Kyrin casts <strong>Psychic</strong> <strong>Whispers</strong> so the Hag can speak to her without any man hearing.</p><p>Things the Hag says to Kyrin in her mind:</p><ul><li><p>If Kyrin mentions <strong>Gyronna</strong>'s name in the hearing of a man, her gaze will be upon her, and she will take vengeance.</p></li><li><p>The Hags were turning the Dryad into something \"more useful\" (a Spriggan). So all Spriggans are females, woops I called them \"he\"…</p></li><li><p>Plex has stolen the lantern from \"her first daughter\" (Elsa??)</p></li><li><p>Plex kept secrets from us… what else is he keeping?</p></li><li><p>The lantern steals joy and colour; they pass through here, but don't stay</p></li></ul><p>Out loud, Fearghas asks why the Feywild is being targeted. \"The Feywild is everything that we should have. It doesn't deserve what it is, what it has, what it ever has been,\" the Hag says. The realm we are in now is called <strong>Muravelara</strong>. She talks shit that we don't know which plane we are in.</p><p>What plane are we in…?</p><p>We're in the Abyss.</p><p>WE'RE IN THE ABYSS.</p><p>Fearghas makes the Hag disembowel herself. I dodge the guts and blood. Emilio slumps down and takes a deep breath. The others loot the place. I find I am clutching my dagger in a white-knuckled grip, barely in control of myself. Staring at the Hag's corpse I feel vague… disappointment. Her last taunt to me rings in my ears, \"You'll feel right at home here…\"</p><p>Loot:</p><ul><li><p>Potions of Heroism 2</p></li><li><p>Mage Wine 4</p></li><li><p>Abyssal Nail Polish 5</p></li></ul><p>We investigate the area, which means several skill checks and consequences for failure.</p><p>Plex, Emilio, Fearghas, and Kyrin stand in a circle and all punch the person to their left after all failed a Nature check. I see my friends brutally descend into madness and hit one another with irrational spite. I scream at them to stop but they can't.</p><p>I pass the check, so I find a Staff of Placeholder because the DM hasn't made it yet.</p><p>We roll investigation, with further anger and slaps from the ones who fail. We find the Hags' full chant. The two last verses, which we managed to stop, are:</p><p><em>The ancient evils stir and creep,</em></p><p><em>While the unwary woods now sleep.</em></p><p><em>This sacred form, we shall defile,</em></p><p><em>With poisoned thought and hateful guile.</em></p><p><em>The charm is cast, the soup is brewed,</em></p><p><em>Her gentle soul is now subdued.</em></p><p><em>From slumber deep, she will arise,</em></p><p><em>With burning rage within her eyes!</em></p><p>DM asks me to roll Arcana with advantage. I roll a 22. The corruption here is different from the magic of the Sibriex but… the corruption on that Dryad is much like what I saw on the monster I killed in its lair… My staff feels so much heavier as we shuffle away from this place to use the lantern again, and return to Heaven.</p>"

          "content": "<p>Freedom was a fight to the death. Unfettered, Emilio's claws slashed air and flesh, spilling dark blood and tearing life essence. It was sweet, not of taste but of feeling. It felt like life, stealing it from a threat and pulling it into himself. All life had to eat, eat or die. Now Emilio was eating, and the Hag was his prey.</p>\n<p>\"What a pretty boy,\" the crone sneered. \"I wonder how you will taste?\"</p>\n<p>\"Try me!\" The words were a growl.</p>\n<p>Her magic hit him, twisted power ripping at his flesh. Diseased blood infected him, sapping his strength. He fought it, snarling. The Void in his flesh swirled, fuelling his strength. Magic did his bidding even in this form, magic as ravenous as his mind. Fire formed in his mind; he hurled it from the distant stars. Flames fell from another sky, purple flames that devoured. The Hag screeched, her magic rising to shield her. Too late; the wrinkled skin was marred with burns. Blood for blood. If he was slow, if he stumbled, if his strength failed him, Emilio would die.</p>\n<p>He loved every second of it. Cosmic energy blazed in his veins. No cowering in the shadows, no looking over his shoulder. His own blood on his tongue invigorated him. The Hag reached out with crooked fingers, claws. They could not be as sharp as his. Brittle bones and thin skin! Fingers like steel wrapped around his throat; the other hand rushed towards his face. No claws sharper than his! He had been broken and remade in a primal vortex. No crone, no matter how magical, would undo him!</p>\n<p>Emilio's claws shot up, scoring the Hag's wrist as he grabbed her arm. Something flashed in her eyes — not fear, but spite. He grinned. Two could play this game. He squeezed the fragile wrist; the muscles under his fingers tensed, the creature's breath grew shallow. Pain. She was hurting. Emilio's own wounds seemed distant. His grin widened as she struggled. Before he could snap her bones, she wrenched her arm free. Disappointing, but there would be other chances. Emilio crouched to lunge at her throat. He had not thought her hair would be a weapon.</p>\n<p>Tangled greasy locks whipped at him, latching onto his skin. Pain seared through him, his strength leeching from his limbs. For a second his vision blurred; he forced his eyes to focus. Control — he'd had to seize control, a lifetime ago. He held control. His body, his hands, they answered his command, they were in his grasp. He would not let his knees bend. He would not fall. With a roar, he turned his will to physical strength and slashed through the disgusting hair. Separated from the Hag's body the ends that touched him fell dead, leaving angry marks on his skin, oozing blood. He would heal, later. Once he'd killed her, he would eat. Emilio would feel better then. He moved to attack, limbs heavy. His blood was sluggish. He would not get dizzy. Win first. Live, then sleep. Fight on. Fight on!</p>\n<p>A light touch on his back. Emilio would have spun around and gutted whatever approached him, but he sensed no threat behind him. A killer, he would have felt coming; bloodlust was impossible to hide from him. The Void pulsed with bloodlust; he knew it as well as his heartbeat. On the small of his back was Naami's hand.</p>\n<p>Why was she here? Up close? Was she mad?</p>\n<p>\"I put my hope in you,\" she whispered.</p>\n<p>Overwhelming magic blossomed, power capable of tearing through reality. Naami's magic was gentle, washing over him like deep silence. Darkness without a sound, dreamless sleep. For a moment out of time, his mind bathed in blessed quiet. Emotion floated away. The struggle for survival, his eternal fight, was distant and muted. He took a deep breath, drinking in the regenerative calm. The spell sank into his body, mending cuts and bruises, lending him strength. Another healing spell filled him with bursting energy. As his body was restored, his mind returned. In the next heartbeat, he was fighting again.</p>\n<p>Claws flexing, he bared his teeth. His own energy surged from deep within. Emilio glimpsed the fabric of the world, saw himself placed on it. Through that weave, he shifted. He appeared a short distance away, his understanding of reality fading. More importantly, he stood on the other side of the boiling pool, the crimson cauldron the Hag had been stirring. It roiled by his feet, noxious fumes drifting up. With a laugh, Emilio raised his hand towards the Hag. Eldritch energy burst from his claws, hitting the crone's body. She spat at him, shrugging off the attack. Exultant, Emilio commanded the magic as a part of himself. Grasp, pull. The Hag's face dropped in surprise as Emilio's spell yanked her towards him.</p>\n<p>Her feet caught on gnarled roots; with a screech she tipped forward and plunged into the boiling cauldron. Blood hissed, erupting, dragging the foul creature under. Boiled by her own magic. Emilio's blood sang in triumph, his mind rejoicing in the kill. Sated? Never. But for a short while he felt joy, an all-consuming golden fire within.</p>\n<p>His own magic flared around him. Emilio spun, sensing energy wrap around his head, around his throat. Panicked, he raised his claws and the magic fled, having wrought its change. A wild magic surge! The insides of his skull twisted in agony. No! He had won! He was alive! He opened his mouth to shout an insult at the dying Hag, to assert his victory and defy the unpredictable magic. \"I am no one's prey!\" The words formed within, and refused to come out. A dog's deep bark broke out of him. Confusion. Words? They were inside, barely. He grasped at meanings, catching nothing but smoke.</p>\n<p>It was the wild magic. His words… His humanity… He fought to hold them close. He fought as if drowning; magic was stronger than him, all around his mind, submerging his thoughts. Verbs warped into images, sentences became smells. Close by, Fearghas shouted. Emilio smelled another Hag and threw himself at her. Control slipped his grasp. He fumbled for it, for what made him human and not voidborn. Both hunted. Both ate. Both killed. Which was he?</p>\n<p>Lyrielle…</p>\n<p>He tore blood from that other Hag; his mind sharpened to a razor blade, Emilio wrapped a mist of blood around his claws. He would kill that Hag too, and the last one behind the tree. He would kill, then he would eat. He would live. His past was only a history of killing and eating. Even after he escaped the Void… his mind recoiled at the memory. Head spinning, his world narrowed to a point, the tip of a claw. Survival instinct needed no language. He needed no words.</p>\n<p>The last Hag appeared, from being shunted through time by Plex' magic; the party's attacks converged on her. Emilio tried to reach her, tried to attack. His body would not move, his mind at war with itself.</p>\n<p>\"If I can't have her,\" the Hag shrieked, \"you can't have her either!\"</p>\n<p>Running from magical attacks, dodging weapon strikes, the Hag rushed into the tree. Her shadowy form a blur, Fade followed. Emilio found he could run after her. Feline limbs would move. An animal would chase after its prey. A voidborn would kill and eat. Emilio moved as both. A spell that required no words… he knew one. Claws catching the blood moon's light, he draped magic over them and over himself. One with his claws, one with his spell, one with his killing instinct. A hollow wind carried him to his prey, who had fallen to Fade's jaws. A roar burst from his chest, louder than human lungs could produce. It was the roar of a mighty beast. Emilio was a beast again. Before language, there had been roars. Before eating, there had been devouring. Before humanity, there had been the voidborn.</p>\n<p>And a voidborn was hungry. A voidborn was tortured by hunger, starving, always ravenous. Emilio… was voidborn. His claws tore into the Hag's body, sinking into the flesh. He cackled and exulted, delighting in tearing his prey to shreds. But there could be no waste, not in a place as hostile as the Far Realms. Food was so scarce. Tendrils slithered from his claws, plunging into his prey's body. Prey was food. Food was life. The tendrils tore chunks from the Hag, absorbing them. The claws snapped bones, drinking in their dust. The still-warm corpse was reduced to essence, feeding Emilio's gauntlets, feeding the void inside. He tried to fill his past with the life force of the creature. He absorbed it to sate a void. He was instinct. He would survive.</p>\n<p>Emilio stood in the ecstasy of having consumed a threat to his life. He barely saw Naami run past him, past the puddle of blood in front of him. Nothing else remained from the Hag. Through a red haze, Emilio saw the Dryad's body, torn apart in the Hag's last act of defiance. How the crone had paid for that! Death sought life, vengeance sought injury. He wanted to laugh. Somehow, Naami's scream stopped him. Why would a voidborn pause for a Halfling's voice…?</p>\n<p>The healer knelt by the Dryad's ruined body, screaming and sobbing. Her small form shook as she clenched her fists. Frustration… rage… pain… Emilio could nearly taste them. Fearghas stepped to Naami. They spoke. Words were no use to a beast. The Dwarf's magic forced the Fey's body back together, torn limbs knitting to chest and hips. Naami watched, eyes wide, her cheeks glistening. Why cry? Why hurt? Another creature was dead. That was cause for joy. Joy, and feasting. Emilio's hands burnt, his claws twitching. A Fey would taste better than that Hag, despite the corruption marring her body. He lifted his hand.</p>\n<p>Fearghas crushed a gem, releasing the spell within. The Dryad's chest stirred, breath returning. Disappointment, swept away by anger. That he would <em>dare</em> steal prey! Emilio's breathing quickened, the blood roaring through his veins. He would not allow that. Could not allow that. How… dare…</p>\n<p>With a sound like star shards shattering, the power left Emilio. It was always abrupt, going from the absolute freedom of his Void Form, back to a stealthy disguise. Usually, he tracked time and was prepared for it. This time, something cracked like a whip in his mind. The world tilted nauseatingly around him; pain flared in his side. He had collapsed on the rough bark.</p>\n<p>Emilio was human. Humans did not devour other creatures without leaving so much as a bone behind. Pain wracked him, body in mind, memories flooding his brain. He tried to let them out, tried to speak, but there were no words to be made. There was no humanity in him to form sentences. He sobbed; he heard himself whimper like a wounded dog.</p>\n<p>Naami knelt beside him. Her magic… different. Powerful as earlier, even more powerful. A spell was laid atop him, not a spell to repair and heal but a spell to undo and purify. The quiet enveloped his mind again. He nearly gave in to it, nearly let it cradle his aching soul — then he felt the positive energy reach his hands, and panic took over. How would the gauntlets react? If they attacked her… if they tried to devour her just like he had devoured the Hag…</p>\n<p>Emilio had no strength left, but he had to protect her. With a gasp of pain, he kicked Naami away. She gave a surprised squeak; he saw exhaustion on her face. He saw her wrists bare, the safety of her spellwards discarded for a moment. He felt the magic that lingered on him; it pulsed with power, with Naami's life force. She had overexerted herself to cast that spell. Idiot. She had been warned about that.</p>\n<p>\"I'm sorry,\" Emilio said.</p>\n<p>Searing pain cut through his brain and was gone in an instant. His thoughts were back to normal, back to what they had been after learning to speak. His words… he really was human. And with language returning, guilt crushed him. He could not keep it quiet; it cut him inside.</p>\n<p>\"I'm so sorry. It won't happen again, I promise. I didn't want to! I'm sorry. I did it again, never again, you mustn't know, I'm so sorry…\"</p>\n<p>The words spilled from him, just as sharp on their way out. He could not stop them. Kyrin and Fearghas crouched by his side, offering comforting words. But… he could not receive them. He had no right, not after what he had done. Not after today. Not… not ever. Never! He could not be trusted around people! He would… again…</p>\n<p>\"Leave him,\" Kyrin said. Sadness in her voice? \"We can't help him now. We need to be asking some questions first.\"</p>\n<p>\"You've got this, son,\" Fearghas said. Kindness. Emilio sobbed. \"Plex? What did you do to the Hag?\"</p>\n<p>\"That's rich coming from you, Fearghas,\" Naami muttered. \"Are you controlling her body? What kind of magic is <em>that</em>, blood magic?\"</p>\n<p>\"Just a little enchantment. Don't worry about it.\" The dwarf shrugged.</p>\n<p>Emilio raised his head just a little. If there was danger… if they had to fight… he would protect. The small green wizard stood proudly next to the crone, brush in hand, admiring his work. The Hag was painted from head to toe in vivid blue. Behind him, Naami snorted. Surprising himself, Emilio chuckled.</p>\n<p>\"Well,\" the dwarf said, \"artistic inclinations notwithstanding… Plex, your assistance?\"</p>\n<p>The goblin nodded enthusiastically, casting a spell of his own. Emilio recognised the pattern; a spell to search someone's mind. It was to be an interrogation. Predictably, the Hag refused to cooperate. Fearghas' frustration rose despite Plex' effort to read the creature's thoughts. Twisting his fingers in unsettling patterns, Fearghas forced the creature to eat one of her own fingers. Naami pressed her hands to her stomach, face drained of colour. They… needed him. Shaking, wrestling with his own body, Emilio stood. Weariness held him in a death grip, but his heart still beat. He approached the Hag, glaring.</p>\n<p>\"Answer the questions. Now. Or I will show you true madness and fear. I will show you worse than what I've been through the last fifteen years.\"</p>\n<p>\"What do <em>you</em> know of suffering,\" she spat. \"No <em>man</em> shall show me suffering. It would be child's play! What I have lived through would break any man.\"</p>\n<p>Emilio smiled, though there was no joy in it. That was almost reassuring. He shuddered at the memory of the exhilaration that came with killing. It would return. He did not fear it, as long as he too would return from it. Despite the gravity of the situation, he delighted in every word he managed to speak.</p>\n<p>\"It did break me,\" he said softly, \"but I grew from it. I became the very monsters that broke me.\"</p>\n<p>On the last sentence, his voice became steel. Plex shook his head.</p>\n<p>\"More spite,\" the goblin said. \"Hatred. So much hatred.\"</p>\n<p>\"What are you doing to the Feywild, and why?\" Fearghas snapped. \"Who is the one-eyed?\"</p>\n<p>\"I cannot tell you that,\" the crone said with an ominous sneer. \"I could introduce <em>them</em> to her.\"</p>\n<p>She nodded to Naami and Kyrin. \"You're not doing a thing to them!\" Emilio said.</p>\n<p>\"Because we're women, I assume.\" Kyrin stepped forward, wisps of magic curling like smoke around her. \"Fine. Say it to me, then. The men won't hear.\"</p>\n<p>Faint whispers just on the edge of hearing told Emilio that Kyrin was using telepathy. She would give them a report later. Silence stretched uncomfortably before the changeling signalled she was done.</p>\n<p>\"Why is the Feywild being targeted?\" Fearghas asked aloud.</p>\n<p>\"The Feywild is everything that we should have,\" the hateful creature grated. \"It doesn't deserve what it is, what it has, what it ever has been! This place… Muravelara… is what we get.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's… not a place I've heard of,\" the dwarf grumbled.</p>\n<p>The Hag's eyes widened in outrage. \"You come here, using the mother's arts, refusing to honour her name, and you don't even know where you are? What plane you are in?\"</p>\n<p>\"I can guess,\" Fearghas said sombrely. \"The Abyss.\"</p>\n<p>\"The Abyss!\" She cackled. \"You're in the Abyss! I'll kill you and corrupt your corpses!\"</p>\n<p>Naami was in front of the Hag, dagger drawn and glowing in the sickly light. \"You're not doing any more of that, you fiend,\" the little healer spat.</p>\n<p>The monster only cackled louder. \"The Abyss! You'll feel right at home here, little one…\"</p>\n<p>Naami's knuckles on her weapon went bone white.</p>\n<p>\"Enough!\" Fearghas said and gestured sharply.</p>\n<p>Still laughing madly, the Hag plunged her fingernails into her stomach, pulling and dragging, collapsing as her guts spilled out. Naami leapt back, swaying on her feet. She sheathed her dagger with jerky motions, her entire body stiff. Emilio had a good idea of what she was feeling. From her stance, her shifting glance, the set of her jaw… disappointment. A shiver raced down his spine; before he knew it, his back slammed into the giant tree's bark. He slumped to the ground, breathing, just breathing. He could not bring himself to do much else. It was a victory. He was alive. He was Emilio.</p>"

We have a long talk with the marshal, explain our plan to get into Dis and threaten Zariel. She advises us to research and scout the Black Vents before rushing in, not that we would EVER rush in with 0 prep, haha. We could go to <strong>Mechanus</strong> for inspiration from <strong>Brigh</strong>, goddess of clockwork. We get permission to walk the Pilgrim's Path to the second layer to attend the memorial for Ezeriel's squad.</p>\n<p>To Plex' great delight, we go shopping in the middle of the night. We find an angel by the name of <strong>Ventriel</strong> painting his wings. Kyrin commissions an item that will change the colour of our harpy's wings so she can match her outfits. Plex talks art for hours before buying several <del>pans of caint</del> cans of paint and breaking the universe with math. Emilio buys a spell component and we all talk about pirates for some reason? Then Kyrin treats us all to unpronounceable donuts, yippee!</p>\n<p>We go to the Library and meet <strong>Claude</strong>, a Quadron. Communication is difficult, we leave him searching for information on a way down to Dis. It will take a long time so we go back to the inn where we eat amazing food.</p>\n<p>We spend the next day chilling, as Claude is still looking for the information we requested. Shalkoc, Aviana, and Plex go to the baths and eat delicious food. Fearghas, Kyrin, and Emilio hit the books. I tag along with them for a while, then my neck gets all achy so I go to the infirmary and watch the angels work their healing. I receive 2 flasks of <strong>holy water</strong> during that time, for reasons best left unsaid. <del>Imagine reading your spells properly</del>.</p>\n<p>Our Tuesday begins with Plex banging on our doors because his <strong>lantern</strong> is glowing. We go eat breakfast; as Shalkoc and Aviana leave the room for more food, Plex activates his lantern and teleports us into an eerie swamp bathed in the light of a blood moon. \nWe don't know where we are. \nPlex doesn't know where we are.\nStay close to the lantern.\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</p>\n<p>This realm has two moon phases, blood moon and new moon, opposite of the moon in the Material Plane. Plants are dead or dying of rot and mould. We trudge through the marsh and find 2 <strong>Spriggans</strong>, fight and kill one of them (not before he slaps Plex real hard). The other runs away carrying an unconscious <strong>Dryad</strong>. We give chase, and run into a ritual held by 4 <strong>Blood Hags</strong>.</p>\n<p>We roll initiative, one of them falls into her own cauldron and dies, thank you Plex! Terrifying battle ensues, we try to stop the ritual to save the Dryad. Predictably, it does not go well. We do stop the ritual, Fearghas uses <strong>bloodbending</strong> on a Hag and now controls her, I give him the side eye, we will have WORDS about this later. The Dryad died, torn apart by the last Hag before we could kill her. We don't know how Emilio killed that Hag really, we found him next to a puddle of blood, the Hag's body nowhere to be seen. Fade was there and saw it happen, but she can't speak and she's just really uneasy. What spooks an undead shadow panther anyway…?</p>\n<p>Fearghas reassembles the Dryad and brings her back to life, but she is mostly corrupted into a Spriggan now. Emilio got a surge that makes him incapable of speaking a language, he just makes animal noises. He reverts to his human form after combat and collapses. I channel an 8th-level <strong>Remove Curse</strong> on him, he kicks me away. Ability to speak restored, he curls into a ball whimpering \"I'm sorry, I did it again, I'm so sorry\" over and over. Fearghas and Kyrin try to comfort him, but only Plex can get a chuckle out of him.</p>\n<p>How? Plex painted the Hag <strong>blue</strong> while nobody was looking.</p>\n<p>We interrogate the Hag with some old-fashioned torture and intimidation. Kyrin telepathically learns some info about \"<strong>the mother</strong>\", a one-eyed goddess who hates men.

          "content": "<p><strong>Tuesday, 5</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> Decimus, 1497</strong></p><p><strong>13:22</strong></p><p>Plex picks up all the loot while Fearghas is distracted. He finds some Troll Musk Concentrate (1), Sneezing Powder (1), Vanishing Velvet (4), and Wandering Wart (1).</p><p>Back in <strong>Heaven</strong>, Shalkoc and Aviana are absolutely not worried about us and are happily eating sandwiches and swiping food from the buffet for when we return. The angels tell them off, predictably. They try to sneak off as much food as they can. Ah yes, the Barbarian Path of the Primal Squirrel. They investigate the lantern but roll like concentrated essence of ass, grab the lantern, and go to the baths. At one point the lantern's faint glow disappears and we all pop up… outside Heaven's Gates. A very confused <strong>Pit Fiend</strong> and 2 <strong>Merregons</strong> look at us. The celestials atop the wall are equally confused. The corrupted Dryad appears next to us, still unconscious.</p><p>Well, shit.</p><p>Kyrin slaps down her <s>Snortable</s> <strong>Portable Hole</strong> to push the Dryad in. Plex casts <strong>Darkness</strong>. One of the Merregons attacks me but gets a surge and starts drowning in air, he can breathe water though! He also gets slapped by the realm effect <strong>Forced Peace</strong>. Emilio Eldritch Blasts it and kills it, then jumps into Kyrin's hole. I scream at the angels to let us in, looks like they are planning to do just that! Then I grab the Dryad and drag her into the hole with me. Now there is one sentient (debatable) root, one potato, and one traumatised boy in the hole, in addition to the vegetables stored in there.</p><p>The Pit Fiend casts <strong>Fireball</strong>. Fearghas dodges for half, Kyrin has the sickest dodges and takes no damage. Plex ran away so he doesn't get hit. Then the Pit Fiend uses <strong>Terminal Command</strong> to order his friend to walk up to us and explode. Nani?! Fearghas runs behind Plex towards the gates. Kyrin picks up the hole with all of us in it and teleports, then dashes right up to the gates. Plex does a Fey Step closer to the gates, and grabs Fearghas with a <strong>Vortex Warp</strong>.</p><p>The Pit Fiend moves up to Plex, close enough to count his hats. Fearghas grabs him into a <strong>Dimension</strong> <strong>Door</strong> and the celestials swoop down to pick us up. We get told that we have to go through registration again, no exceptions. Kyrin is treated with less suspicion this time, and our guidance levels are lower than last time. The Dryad is taken to the hospital in the meantime. We return to the inn where we find Shalkoc with his guards, who are flabbergasted to see Shalkoc is STILL eating.</p><p>Huey, Dewey, Louie, Laurel, and Hardy ask if we are fine. Fearghas lightly says we are fine. I glare at him. Shalkoc asks if we found some food. Fearghas says no, Emilio looks very green in the face. Plex casually says \"I guess we'll have to find another way to the <strong>Abyss</strong> next time.\"</p><p>Silence. You can hear a pin drop in the room. The five angels says \"the WHAT?!\" in perfect unison. Plex backpedals and lies. The angels question him. Fearghas masterfully saves the situation, by just telling the truth. That easy, huh. Shalkoc's bodyguards are horrified by Fearghas' story, and one of them immediately informed one of his superior. We might have to answer a few more questions. The celestials suggest we go join Aviana at the <strong>baths</strong> to relax, as we all look pretty roughed up.</p><p>Shalkoc wants to find a big tree to meditate under, after eating all this food. He gets inspiration twice, from eating a pickle and looking at Emilio's cloak. Jackpot! We start talking about burgers. Emilio really does not look well. We go to the baths and find Aviana, wearing only a towel, who thought we were stuck inside the <strong>lantern</strong> and poured some bathwater into it so we'd have something to drink. Plex teleports himself into the water fully clothed. The floors are dented as if she had been banging the lantern onto the marble.</p><p>Emilio has never been to a bathhouse. He hesitantly dips a finger in. Fearghas explains, then disrobes and jumps in. I follow suit; Emilio is more hesitant but reluctantly takes off his cat-eared hoodie and the rest of his gear, and gets in. Fearghas is embarrassed that I'm so close and looks away, I'm not paying attention, just making bubbles. Aviana demands an <strong>orange</strong> from Plex in exchange for the lantern, then chases him around whipping a towel. Kyrin is washing the soot from her clothes. Emilio is floating and relaxing a little bit, his gauntlets cleaner than I've ever seen them. Fearghas begins the five-stage process of cleaning a dwarven beard.</p><p>Fearghas stays about half an hour, then heads to the library. Emilio follows after a while. The others begin to leave one by one. I stay for a good three hours, just enjoying the water. Aviana is the only one still soaking when I go looking for the others. And Plex, who is sitting in the cleavage of the water-pouring statue. Aviana tells him to get down because \"Thou shalt not defile that which is sacred\" and boobs are sacred. Aerelia inspiredly says \"Yeah!\". It's canon. Female clerics can use their boobs as holy symbols. Plex jumps down as Fearghas yells \"Do a flip!\" We find Shalkoc banging his head on a tree, trying to trigger a surge.</p><p>We head to the library, and as we open the door we start to cough in a wave of grey smoke. <strong>Claude</strong> the librarian is smoking next to a pile of tomes, the research we requested from him. The Quadron's eyes are rolling in their sockets, gone blue, his mouth is smoking. He is stuck in an error and reboot loop from researching the <strong>Void</strong>… Fearghas, Emilio, and myself realise trying to help might be dangerous because of Void corruption. Plex tries to fix him, passes an INT save… Aviana knows how to fix him, and casts <s>Concussive Maintenance</s> <strong>Mending</strong>.</p><p>\"Sometimes it's a stroke of genius, sometimes it's just a stroke.\" - Kyrin, casually throwing the table into chaos.</p><p>Aviana knocked Claude on the head so hard he forgot the last backup, and restored data from before he was researching the Void. Shalkoc wants to take Claude home. His bodyguards are not pleased with him. Aviana nearly breaks Claude all over again; I kindly ask the Quadron to cancel the request for information about the Void.</p><p>I ask Claude about his research about <strong>Ley Lines</strong>. They criss-cross the land, often following its contours, carrying magic. People often recognise the signs of Ley Lines without realising what they are. They often follow waterways, as they also take the path of lesser resistance. People have tried to use them, but it's dangerous. They vary in intensity, and can be harnessed. <strong>Fey Roads</strong> or <strong>Shadow Roads</strong> are tied to Ley Lines. Harnessing Ley Lines is taxing and dangerous. On one, you can tap into its power to regain spell slots, or recharge a magic item (conditions apply).</p><p><strong>Ley magic</strong>: special spells that can only be cast with the help of a Ley Line. Practicing Ley magic without being properly trained will result in channelling fatigue.</p><p>Kyrin gets some good hints about Changelings; the <strong>Mistborn isles</strong>, where a Shadow Road is said to exist, suggesting a connection between Kyrin's race and the Shadowfell. Psionics are said to be connected to the <strong>Maelstrom</strong> and <strong>Gem Dragons</strong>.</p><p>Shalkoc: Am I a gem dragon??</p><p>Laurel: You may not be a gem dragon, but you certainly are a gem.</p><p>Aviana: A secondhand gem maybe.</p><p>Fearghas tells Plex, again, that the <strong>Void Dragon</strong> is not his friend and wants to kill him. Aviana asks Emilio about \"friendship in the Void\". Emilio says that in the Void, there is no friendship, only \"feast or be fed on\". He concludes the Void Dragon is out to dine on Plex, who has shown himself as weaker and thereby, a tasty morsel. Emilio theorises that Plex made a pact, not with the dragon but with a higher entity, and maybe that higher entity sent the Void Dragon as food FOR PLEX. The dragon is either Plex' death or his dinner, depending on Plex' strength.</p><p>I suggest Plex start lifting weights with Aviana then. She is thrilled. Emilio is getting frustrated trying to explain the Void to Plex and Shalkoc, but a binary concept is proving too difficult for them. Plex wants the dragon <strong>as a pet</strong>. That is not in the list of options. The list has only two items; eat it, or be eaten by it.</p><p>Kyrin is bamboozled and asks why the Void Dragon is hunting Plex, so Fearghas explains. Painfully, but mainly hilariously. Emilio loses his shit when he learns about the <strong>Demilich</strong> Plex chucked into the Void. Fearghas grabs his book on Avernus and starts to read, grinding his teeth noisily. Something about a planar wound (the planes had fused because of a Wish spell, the devils tore it open, Asmodeus just left it open, that's what the Black Vents are) and the Demon Lord of Monsters and multitude, <s>Echidna</s> Lamashtu.</p><p>How to remove a <strong>permanent curse</strong> on an object: either through a <strong>Wish</strong> spell, or maybe by <strong>transferring</strong> the curse to a living creature. Some ancient priests in the Redwind Sands did such a thing. Well, before they were the Redwind Sands, of course. Mukashi, mukashi.</p><p>There is a note on a <strong>Guardian Golem</strong> waiting for us on Friday 8th Decimus between 4:30am and 4:35am at gate C3H8 in <strong>Mechanus</strong> for us to visit. We'll head there after our next long rest. We plan to head to Avernus after visiting Mechanus, if possible.</p><p>Research done (for now), we go to the infirmary to check on the Dryad. <strong>Caelus</strong> asks what happened to us?! I say a goblin with a lantern happened, it's best not to pry too much. We enquire about the Dryad, Caelus asks us to wait a while. Fearghas explains to Aviana what happened to the Dryad. After a few moments, Master <strong>Clementiel</strong> appears and asks if we saved the Dryad's life. He can't let us see her… her wounds have been healed but she reacted to healing magic by growing bark. She became very aggressive when someone tried to <strong>water the plants</strong>, and the healers had to detain her. She's presumably already killed someone and is raging that no one will defile her forest. The same thing the Spriggan said before attacking us…</p><p>Aviana suggests a <strong>Love Potion</strong>. Fearghas shoots her down, verbally. The Dryad has been locked in an atrium with plants around her. The angels tried to heal her mind, but there was nothing to \"fix\". We visit the Dryad, bearing Clementiel's warnings in mind. She is pacing, her face haunted, looking for intruders. Clementiel casts <strong>Tongues</strong> on us all so we can speak to the Dryad.</p><p>She's disturbed and angry. Everybody wants to hurt her forest. This is not her forest. I ask where she is from, but she doesn't know. \"Moonlit Grove\" is the only name she knows. (Plex knows about 15 Moonlit Groves…) Kyrin asks for her name (\"Ah goddammit!\" - the DM), and what is the last thing she remembers from her grove? Her name is <strong>Joline</strong>, and the last she remembers is cold despair overcoming her, all the joy drained from her. She remembers crying, her tears were strange colours. Kyrin explains to her all that happened, about the Hags, and what is happening to the <strong>Feywild</strong>. The lanterns draining the Feywild belong to <strong>Elsa</strong>, first daughter of the goddess of Hags.</p><p>Aviana draws a circle, sits cross-legged in it and tries to meditate, to commune with spirits.</p><p>When Joline hears Kyrin's story, the trees around her start to tremble, leaves falling like it's suddenly winter. The roots pierce the ground and grow spikes that surround the Dryad, weaving a protective shell around her, Fearghas thinks. Plex corrects him; the <strong>trees</strong> are protecting her, the Dryad isn't doing anything. Embers appear in the trees' bark, as if after a wildfire, after we say we are going after the one who is doing this to the Feywild. Charred branches fall, and the Dryad looks charred as well, anger in her eyes. It's not the confused madness from before. She asks who did this.</p><p>Plex says it's Elsa. Kyrin asks if Joline saw any lantern, but she doesn't know what a lantern is, so Plex shows his lantern. The moment Joline sees the lantern, a wall of <strong>thorns</strong> pops up, hitting the barrier the celestials put up. Kyrin enquires further about lanterns but Joline is back to mad rage, accusing us of defiling her forest, threatening to make us pay, and trying to escape her prison.</p><p>Kyrin uses <strong>Psychic Whispers</strong> to speak to Joline in her mind, saying we aren't responsible and to please stop attacking. She responds out loud, \"Why should I believe you? Everyone is after my forest. Everyone who says they want to help are lying!\" Emilio says he has no reason to lie; the Hag tried to hurt him, and he will find it and kill it.</p><p>Aviana tries to calm Joline with a ritual, kind of like <strong>Beast Sense</strong>, that's why she was sitting in a circle. She is trying to improwise a new spell. We all roll a WIS save, miraculously all pass because Aviana has no idea what she is doing. She is just trying to \"send good vibes\". It backfires, Aviana feels Joline's rage aaaaaaand she goes into Barbarian <strong>Rage</strong>. She knows how to harness it, and does not lose her mind. She shares with Joline her focused rage; the tangled roots begin to loosen and open up. They're still charred and thorny, and the Dryad steps forward. She says:</p><p>\"Let me out of here. I will not hurt anybody here. You've done nothing to my forest, but I will hunt the one that hurt my forest, until the end of the world if I have to.\"</p><p>She asks where Elsa is, if we can find her. Joline decides she will look for her with us. She is not asking. I ask her if she would be okay leading the efforts to find Elsa. The DM forgets to answer this, don't blame ya Aerelia, there is a lot going on. After discussing among ourselves, we give Joline a choice: send her back to the <strong>Feywild</strong>, or come to <strong>Promise</strong> and look over my trees (I disagree).</p><p>She is confused that nobody is looking after our forest. We say there is a spider looking after it (<strong>Kali</strong>). She wants to come to Promise and take care of the forest, as mortals are no good with that. She demands to be let out of her prison in Heaven.</p><p>Plex says cutting trees is like leather clothes. Only Aviana understands this, and explains. Shalkoc gets it. The rest of us are confused.</p><p>Fearghas pops a spellgem of <strong>Sending</strong> to contact Kali and explain the situation, warn her to not let anyone near Joline's grove. We warn Joline about Kali's appearance. Another Sending to Gavel to tell him what's going on. Then, we speak with the angels to ask Joline be released. And finally, Aviana yanks the <strong>Transdimensional Anchorchain</strong> to open the portal to Promise, with the wizards' help so she can make the superhigh DC. She fails twice, blames Plex, tries again. With a roar for effect, she takes the tug-of-war stance. Plex helps, by jumping up and grabbing the chain, hanging from it.</p><p>The portal opens! We see Kali through it but she doesn't seem to see us? It's a one-way portal because we're in Heaven. <s>Fearghas wants to launch me like a pebble</s>. We let Joline go through, and the portal closes. Aviana says this is all thanks to Plex.</p><p>We go to the markets again for <strong>spell components</strong>, and a towel for Aviana (among others). Afterwards, we return to the inn. Fearghas checks on Kyrin, and rages about the Lawful Stupid alignment (Plex'). I go check on Emilio because he was looking mighty green earlier.</p><hr><p><strong>Wednesday, 6</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> Decimus, 1497</strong></p><p><strong>7:47</strong></p><p><strong>Short rest</strong></p><p>We head to the <strong>Pilgrim's Path</strong>. There are small shrines on the way with lit candles and offerings. The cliff face is very steep; lichen grows in places, sometimes sprinkled with flowers. Kyrin asks if she may pick a few. Huey, Dewey, and Louie say yes. One of the Planetars (Laurel) is going ahead… and disappears. We catch up, don't see him. Then Hardy disappears from behind us. One after the other, we appear in <strong>Mercuria</strong>. The time it takes for each of us is different, we all wander at our own pace. In total it's a good 7-hour walk. I pass through first, and Fearghas is last (after grumbling to Shalkoc who was second-to-last). He mutters very heartily, and louder by the second! Until it reaches the ears of Torag, who says, if you're having trouble with anger management, try journalling! Write it in a book! Fearghas yells about his Hall of Grudges, and passes through! He suddenly pops up ahead of us, screaming and raging. Laurel asks if he is okay. I offer him a cookie. He lifts his magical tankard, fills it with ale, and downs it in one go.</p><p>We round a corner and come to a lush valley, spreading out before us. This is <strong>Iomedae</strong>'s realm, the Halls of Valor. I have words with Fearghas about his <strong>blood magic</strong>. The others thought I'd yell at him but… to be honest I'm mostly worried about him. About what the darkness of these spells would do to him, to his soul. He waves my concerns away, says he's fine. I'm not entirely convinced… I admit I'm also really unsettled by that magic. When Fearghas asks why, I say \"because those spells hurt everyone\". He argues it doesn't, really, and those spells are a last resort. We grumble back and forth about magic and evil.</p>"

          "name": "83.1 - A sweet tea",
          "section": "journal-pages",
          "content": "<p>There was no night in Heaven. For someone who had lived most of his life in darkness, it was more than a little unsettling. Not really a matter of sleep — Emilio could sleep when he wanted to. He'd had to learn this. And he loved sunlight. But this constant glow, even during the nightly hours, felt wrong. It reminded him all too keenly that, once more, he was not in the Material Plane. He was in another world, one he understood so much less than home.</p>\n<p>Emilio's room was comfortable, with a lot of space even for a single person. He imagined it had been designed by and for winged people. The wood panelling was simple but elegant, the bed was soft and comfortable. There was no fireplace like those Emilio was used to; instead, one of the walls had a niche holding a large, milky orange crystal. If he touched the surface, he could adjust the temperature it radiated into the room. He needed one of those in his room on Promise. A washstand was topped by a gleaming silvery tap. A small table bore a lamp filled with scented oil, and had two cushioned chairs on either side. At the foot of the bed stood a chest without a lock.</p>\n<p>A timid knock at the door. Emilio jumped, though he had known it would come.</p>\n<p>He made his voice steady. \"Enter.\"</p>\n<p>The panelled door swung without a sound as Naami stepped in, carrying a tray. The Halfling looked a lot better than she had; her scrapes and burns had been healed, but she still looked weary. Some of that fatigue… Emilio looked away. He sat cross-legged on his bed, in full view from the door. Clearly, angels had no need for privacy screens.</p>\n<p>\"I brought you something to eat,\" Naami said, setting her tray on the small table. \"It should help you feel better.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm not hungry.\" Emilio's voice came out rougher than he intended. Control. Never let them smell your fear.</p>\n<p>He'd anticipated she would notice. There had been chaos at dinner, with Kyrin shifting her appearance to Shalkoc's while the real Shalkoc sipped soup, talking herbs with Naami. Fearghas had had to stop Aviana from putting a collar and leash on Plex while he obliviously changed the colours of his mushroom dish, trying to make every fungus its own vibrant shade. His task accomplished, the goblin had promptly forgotten the grilled mushrooms and become fascinated with his fork, of all things. Fearghas' Mage Hand was holding a vial filled with a bright pink liquid out of Aviana's reach. Fake Shalkoc and real Shalkoc were duelling with chicken drumsticks. Shalkoc's five bodyguards watched with faces carefully blank.\nEmilio had endured as long as he could before muttering an excuse and slipping out.</p>\n<p>\"You didn't touch your food,\" Naami said. \"You'll need your strength tomorrow.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm fine, really.\"</p>\n<p>He still dodged her eyes. She would look at him with worry and some confusion. He was sure of it. The concern… he could not face it. Would not face it. Not after kicking her away. Not after what he'd done. He had not even lied; he didn't feel hungry. Well, his stomach growled occasionally. But he felt… fed. That sensation was familiar, to an extent. He had been hunted by voidborn. He had fought them and killed them, so of course he had eaten them. Well, the gauntlets had. That was natural. Voidborn ate other voidborn, and Emilio was part voidborn. What he had tried, unsuccessfully, to explain to Plex was the simple logic of the Void; you fight, or you flee. If you fight and win, you eat, and you live. Outside the Void, it was a lot more complicated. People didn't eat people. Even something as twisted and disgusting as a Blood Hag… was not voidborn. He had done it again.</p>\n<p>He was nauseous, not from hunger. Against his better judgement, he glanced at the tray Naami had brought. It held a bowl, blessedly covered, a small teapot, and two mugs. Smells wafted into the room despite the lid. It smelled… good. Vegetables, grain, and broth. Probably a nutritious meal to help a sick person recover. But Emilio wasn't sick. He had… he was…</p>\n<p>A monster. The smells of food were too much. Emilio's head spun, his stomach clenched painfully. Sweating with the effort of fighting the nausea, he gritted his teeth. Bile burnt his throat. He could not have stood even had he tried to. Don't let it show. Never show weakness. If he looked like prey for just a second, he would <em>become</em> prey. His hands trembled. He could not assume his Void Form now; the earlier fight had drained him. Magic…? He could summon a minor spell. Enough to repel an attack. It would buy him time. He could escape into the Astral Plane, just long enough to recover.</p>\n<p>\"You don't look fine at all.\"</p>\n<p>Naami's voice. She had taken a step closer. There was no threat coming from her, but Emilio fought down panic. She must not know. None of them must know. If they learnt what he had done, they would execute him like a rabid animal. Was that not what he had shown himself to be? A beast.</p>\n<p>\"I… I'm tired from the fight,\" he forced out. \"I'll eat later.\"</p>\n<p>She reached a hand towards him, hesitated. \"May I take a look at you? If you're ill, I can help.\"</p>\n<p>He nearly laughed. \"I'm not ill.\"</p>\n<p>Uneasy silence. Then, she sighed and drew a chair.</p>\n<p>\"I'm not good with combat,\" she said, as if to herself. \"I loose my cool. I panic. I use magic impulsively, and tax myself. But I am good at treating injuries and diseases. I see things others don't notice. I know you're not feeling well, and you don't want me to know. I won't pry any more. You probably have a good reason. I'm not here to force you.\"</p>\n<p>He looked up, then. She was tiny, sitting with her eyes down, her hands clasped above the table. She looked weak. She wouldn't survive a minute in the Void.</p>\n<p>\"How did you survive this long?\" He had not meant to ask, really.</p>\n<p>\"By not being alone. The times when I had nobody… that's when it got bad. That's when I thought I would die. You're not alone now.\"</p>\n<p>There was warmth in Emilio's chest. Confused, he felt at his heart. Much like in the baths earlier, his shoulders relaxed. It reminded him of Lyrielle. The feeling nearly drove the nausea away for a moment. It was frightening… it was good.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you,\" Emilio said.</p>\n<p>Naami nodded. \"Do you feel up to some tea?\"</p>\n<p>He grimaced. \"Can try…?\"</p>\n<p>She poured two cups, and handed one to him. Light green, the warm liquid had a delicate herbal scent. It seemed mixed with some kind of milk. Emilio just held the cup, feeling the warmth. Naami took a sip and grinned.</p>\n<p>\"No pressure to try it,\" she said, \"but I think it's lovely. A sweet tea does wonders for bitter memories.\"</p>\n<p>It certainly smelled lovely. Emilio's stomach rumbled and twisted. He hoped Naami had not heard it. He thought she had.</p>\n<p>\"Your hands,\" she said. Emilio tensed. \"The angels called it a \"disfigurement\". Scars. I thought so too, at first, though more along the lines of a curse. The more I see you fight, the less convinced I am. They don't feel like a wound that can be healed. They're not… damage. They're a part of you, just as Aviana's wings are part of her. Aren't they?\"</p>\n<p>He nodded. Relief warred with fear. She knew about him. She… <em>knew</em> about him? Having this secret found out… was also a weight lifted from his shoulders. He had been so worried she would try to heal his hands, to undo… whatever magic had brought him and the gauntlets together. Would they have lashed out? Would they have hurt her? Or worse… Out of that fear, he had kicked her away. Protected her from what he was. Emilio did not think he could stomach any of the tea. At least the liquid wasn't red. With trembling hands, he set the cup on the nightstand. Naami gave him a sad look.</p>\n<p>\"I don't know much about the Void,\" she said, conspicuously looking away. \"As much as I'd like to keep it that way, I don't think any of us will have the luxury. When we fight more of the creatures from there, I'm counting on you. I'll take the liberty to assume, from experience… not <em>every</em> battle takes a toll on you. In fact I've never seen you this drained after a fight. No, you don't need to confirm or deny. I'm not here to press you on it. I'm just… speaking my theories out loud. Honestly, I blame Fearghas. That magic of his! Would mess up anyone's stomach, and then some.\"</p>\n<p>He let her speak. It was oddly comfortable, especially as he had expected to be pushed for answers. This party… they didn't need to focus on survival. They had enough power to not be threatened by most situations. His body and mind railed against the emerging sense of comfort. Never relax. Never let your guard down. One moment of relief, of thinking he was home and safe… Memories of his village. Naami's voice faded to a murmur as Emilio's hearing was overcome with a rushing sound like a waterfall. Cold sweat. He had to fight for breath. Never again. The portal… His head spun.</p>\n<p>\"Emilio?\"</p>\n<p>Gasping, he snapped out of it. He sensed magic, Naami's. A spell, not yet released. He had both hands pressed to his stomach.</p>\n<p>\"Never again,\" he whispered. He clung to the very words, unwilling to let their echo fade.</p>\n<p>Warm cloth on his forehead, wiping away the sweat. Naami was right in front of him. So small. Anyone else, he might have attacked. She probably could not save herself. Even exhausted as he was, he could — Her magic washed over him, weak yet soothing. Emilio's body softened, his mind began to slow. Reluctantly, the nausea retreated.</p>\n<p>\"Then we'll do our best so it doesn't happen again. All of us. Together.\"</p>\n<p>Emilio's breath caught, his throat aching. She couldn't know. She must not. For the first time in three years, he wanted to cry. <em>It's too late. It has already happened. I tried to prove I'm human. Will I become a beast again?</em></p>\n<p>\"We can't ask Claude for research,\" he heard himself say. \"Too dangerous. And Plex still thinks the Void Dragon is his friend!\"</p>\n<p>She shook her head. \"Don't remind me.\"</p>\n<p><em>And that portal is still open. Has the village changed at all?</em></p>\n<p>Another silence, less awkward this time. He sensed… resolve from her. She sat on the bed in front of him, looking at her hands. No, she was staring at her spellwards. One of the silvery bracelets had a sooty stain on it. She rubbed at the stain. It showed no sign of fading.</p>\n<p>\"Before we entered the Sibriex lair,\" she began, her voice trembling, \"I showed my memories. Remember? Images through the telepathic bond. I could not put them into words. Even now, I would be hard-pressed to do so. Then, it was impossible, the words would just not come out. I know I've gained some manner of forgiveness, attained some form of redemption. It helps. But I don't know if I can ever forgive myself. Being here surrounded by angels… they are lovely people, so kind and sweet. But I close my eyes, and I see the one I killed. You know? Wounds may heal, but they leave scars. Some memories lose their edge, but they never fade.\"</p>\n<p>She closed her eyes. She carried her staff lashed to her back, as usual. She rarely even let it out of her sight. Emilio assumed it was because the staff was her weapon, her means of defending herself.</p>\n<p>\"I don't think the others told you,\" she continued. \"The first time I came to Promise, we talked about Matron Vandree. We asked Kali if she knew anything. She suggested… oh, she was very direct about how much trouble I was in. She said we should h-hire a… a demon… for help. Everyone just treated it as a rational argument. Well, Fearghas wasn't too thrilled. But Aviana seemed to think it was a good idea. She pulled an angel's dress from her pack, I'm not sure how she got her hands on it. And all I could see were memories of the Sibriex lair and the tortured angel. Their words… they brought up memories to beat at my mind. Look, I've been a healer my whole life. I've seen bad wounds, and people who were really sick. I have a strong stomach. That day, I threw up all over the floor. I was so ashamed. I'm not, now. I'm not sure why I'm telling you this. I just want you to know… there is no shame in having horrors in your past. There is no shame in losing to them, even a hundred times. No shame in being unable to get a word out. We keep fighting. If one day the words come to you, and you want to speak them? You know where to find me.\"</p>\n<p>Emilio was shivering, his back pressed against the wall. The exhaustion from the battle, the strain of fighting the nausea, the fear of confessing his real nature… his body was so heavy. Breathing was a struggle. He was just so drained. He wanted to be rid of his burdens but he could not set them down, not yet.</p>\n<p>\"I've seen you angry,\" Naami said, looking past him. \"I've seen you exhausted, and overwhelmed. Mostly I've seen you cold and controlled. I think after today's battle, it was the first time I saw you afraid.\"</p>\n<p>Never show fear. Never let others see your weaknesses. The weak were devoured. The strong feasted. Naami was weak, and strong. Yet somehow, Emilio did not fear her. <em>Yes, I was afraid.</em> He would never admit it, never be made to admit it. Hollow shadows swirled around his heart, keeping it shrouded, keeping him safe. He was not sure when the darkness had come. He knew it was here. It had not stopped light from coming into his life. Doing the right thing. He understood that now.</p>\n<p>\"I'm sorry for kicking you,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, you're fine. I don't hold it against you. I think I startled you? It was a powerful spell I cast on you without warning. You just looked like you… needed it. Urgently.\"</p>\n<p>The memories from the surge flooded back. With considerable effort, Emilio suppressed a shudder. \"You were right,\" he said. \"Why did you not strike me back?\"</p>\n<p>\"For kicking me?\"</p>\n<p>He nodded. She thought for a moment.</p>\n<p>\"Because it's not what I do. I make people better. And, maybe that's selfish? I <em>refuse</em> to let the Hag be right about me, when she said I would be right at home in the Abyss. I'm not a demon; I'm a healer. If that means I will take hits, fine. I'll be who I am. Forgive violence. Heal fear. I'll make the choice to be kind, as many times as it takes.\"</p>\n<p>A choice. Emilio could also make a choice; he would not hurt her. He held control. If he lost it, he would seize it again. He took a deep breath to steady himself, and reached for the cup of tea. It was wonderfully sweet.</p>"

Aviana goes to the baths, taking the lantern.</p>\n<p>We teleport back to Heaven but appear <strong>outside</strong> the gates, where a bunch of confused devils attempt to grill us, literally. We get into Kyrin's hole as planned, and are picked up by the angels. We have to go through registration again, then meet up with Shalkoc. His bodyguards are flabbergasted by the sheer quantity of food he's eaten, showing no sign of stopping. Fearghas says he will get very fat. Shalkoc asks if we found any food in the Lantern Realm. Emilio goes green. Plex, noting the absence of his lantern, casually says \"we'll have to find another way to the <strong>Abyss</strong> next time\". Predictably, the angels are not fans of the Abyss.</p>\n<p>We go meet up with Aviana, who is pouring her bathwater into the lantern, so we can have something to drink in there. We have ourselves a nice soak, even Emilio relaxes. Fearghas goes through the five-step process of cleaning a dwarven beard. Plex climbs into the cleavage of the marble statue pouring water into the pools. Kyrin does her laundry. I make bubbles in the water. Meanwhile Shalkoc finds a tree to meditate under, gets bored of meditating, bangs his head against the tree to trigger a surge.</p>\n<p>We go to the library, where <strong>Claude</strong> the Quadron nearly set himself on fire by getting stuck in a boot loop. Aviana has a stroke of genius and performs concussive maintenance, saving his life. Then tries to break him all over again. Turns out researching the Void is not too healthy. We learn really cool bits and pieces about <strong>Ley Lines</strong> and <strong>Changelings</strong>.</p>\n<p>We have a long, frustrating discussion about the <strong>Void Dragon</strong>. Emilio tries to explain there are no friends in the Void, it's \"feast or be fed on\". Plex refuses to understand the dragon wants to snack on him. Our warlock nearly has a fit when he learns of the Demilich Plex chucked into the portal. Kyrin is bamboozled, so Fearghas tells her the whole story.</p>\n<p>Fearghas rage-reads about the <strong>Black Vents</strong> being a planar wound that Asmodeus decided to not do anything about. The Demon Lord of Monsters and multitude, <strong>Lamashtu</strong>, is involved. Not demon shullbit again… We also find clues on how to remove curses from objects, might find further clues in the <strong>Redwind Sands</strong>?</p>\n<p>A Guardian Golem will wait for us at gate C3H8 in <strong>Mechanus</strong> on Friday 8th Decimus between 4:30am and 4:35am. This shit gonna be fire yo.</p>\n<p>We go check on the Dryad in the infirmary. It is not going well. It is going the opposite of well. They had to lock her up because she went on a murderous rampage when plants were watered. We have a long and tense discussion with her. Aviana does a meditative pose, gets very angry. Joline the Dryad now understands the Barbarian rage and wants to hunt some Hags. We eventually send her to Promise to take care of the <strong>Nirvana trees</strong>, what could possibly go wrong?</p>\n<p>Aviana tugs Promise to her with the <strong>anchor chain</strong>, all thanks to Plex. We go shop for spell components, then have some character moments at the inn.</p>\n<p>The next day, we climb the Pilgrim's Path to <strong>Mercuria</strong>. Fearghas has some trouble with the contemplative walk, shouts so loud Torag can hear him. As we enter the <strong>Halls of Valor</strong>, I have an uncomfortable conversation with Fearghas about his blood magic. They seem evil to me, I worry they will harm him somehow. He says he is fine (tm) and evil magic can be used for good! I'm not super convinced, but can't find really good arguments.</p>"

          "content": "<p><strong>Wednesday, 6</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> of Decimus, 1497</strong></p><p><strong>18:00</strong></p><p>We walk through rolling plains and past giant statues. After 2 hours, we reach a new statue surrounded by a gathering of angels in a somber mood. Some are in full armour, carrying weapons. <strong>Ezeriel</strong> is here, his armour heavily damaged. He welcomes us, and begins the ceremony. Everyone sits down in the grass, us included. Celestials step forth, telling stories of the fallen and their heroic sacrifices. We are encouraged to speak as well, but no pressure. Emilio says a few words of thanks and bows, leaving Ezeriel weeping. I speak as well, thanking the angels for saving us, and promising they will live on in our hearts. Aviana says \"good job!\", which gives Ezeriel a chuckle. Shalkoc places dried meat on the statue as an offering, which confuses most of the people present.</p><p>Ezeriel closes the ceremony by placing seven crystals containing the <strong>tokens</strong> we gave him. The angels get up, adjusting armour like they're going into battle. Ezeriel explains that as a tribute to the fallen, there will be a friendly <strong>martial competition</strong>. There is protective magic that will keep us safe, and we are welcome to join. The game is called Champion of the Hill, he explains the rules to us. Essentially the team with the most members left on the hill when time runs out, wins.</p><p>Kyrin and myself are elected as team <strong>captains</strong>. Kyrin picks Emilio, Plex, and Shalkoc. I pick Aviana and Fearghas, and Ezeriel joins my team to make up the numbers. We get a full refresh before starting. We put our heads together and discuss strategy. Plex wants to immediately concede. Emilio and Fearghas look a little too happy about this whole thing.</p><p>We roll initiative, Aviana says \"Let's do this!\", stomps down, and her skin turns yellow. <s>Super Chicken</s>. She rages and runs into the circle. She earns the <strong>Bear's Blessing</strong>. I step forward and cast <strong>Living Shadows</strong>, but Plex responds with <strong>Temporal Shunt</strong>. All our plans are in tatters. Ezeriel flies into the circle and casts Sacred Flame on Emilio, dealing minor damage, and probably just stoking his fighting spirit. Shalkoc steps into the circle with <strong>Step of the Wind</strong>, then punches Aviana but she dodges. They end up happily bumping first, with no damage occurring. Shalkoc shifts to Turtle Stance.</p><p>Kyrin teleports into the circle and slashes at Aviana with the <strong>Sun Blade</strong>. It's a crit on Aviana! Oh… ooooh no. Her Unflinching feature triggers! She heals for most of the damage, but Kyrin still slaps Mark Soul on her. Aviana reflects all 90 damage on Kyrin. For the Yu-gi-oh players, this is during the damage step. Welp, no response. Emilio casts <strong>Dissonant Whispers</strong> on Aviana, who rolls a dirty 0 on the WIS save. Ouchie. He goes into <strong>Void Form</strong> and uses Phase Shift to teleport into the circle next to Kyrin. Plex puts Fearghas into a box with <strong>Wall of Stone</strong>. He casts <strong>Dimension Door</strong> and appears in the circle, close to Plex. Then he summons a <strong>Spiritual Weapon</strong> and whacks the hell out of Plex.</p><p>Round change! Kyrin - 4 / Naami - 3</p><p>Aviana pops a mythic power, <strong>Legendary Vigor</strong> and proceeds to punt Shalkoc 200 feet backwards, at the speed of light itself. For the low, low price of a bonus action. She grabs Kyrin and squeezes the life out of her, literally, she passes out just dangling in the harpy's claws. The arena's magic takes hold and teleports Kyrin outside of it, restoring her to full health. Aviana is not done grappling, and grabs Emilio.</p><p>I appear from the Temporal Shunt, very confused. Walking into the circle, I slam down the Staff of Power and surround myself with <strong>Wall of Force</strong>. No one is getting me out of that circle. NO ONE. Ezeriel swoops down and bonks Emilio, who tries to slice in response but the angel dodges. Shalkoc is chilling over in Africa, in Turtle Stance too… He ends the stance, toggles Step of the Wind, and dashes back into the arena some 100 feet. Kyrin teleports right back into the circle, close enough to touch Aviana's feathers. She tries to whack her with the Sun Blade, but Aviana dodges.</p><p>Emilio gives Aviana a smug grin, then <strong>Phase Shifts</strong> away… into my Wall of Force. Aviana follows. It sure is crowded under this glass now… Emilio is slicing away at Aviana, but she reflects even more than she took. He slices at her again, and that's a crit! What could possibly go wrong? She uses Stone's Endurance as a reaction, reducing the damage. She also heals back more than she took, and inflicts <strong>Frightened</strong> on Emilio, Shalkoc, Kyrin, and Plex! The entire enemy team wants to run away! Go Aviana! But her skin changes colour again, she is now half-yellow, half-grey, like a very old chicken.</p><p>Plex dashes behind the nearest rock to break line of sight. This pleases Fearghas <em>greatly</em>. He chases Plex with the Spiritual Weapon, tries to chuck his axe at him, it does not go well. Not only does he miss but Plex tries a <strong>Temporal Shunt</strong> on him. Fearghas responds with a Magic Mirror, bouncing the spell back on Shalkoc. Chain 3! Shalkoc fails the save and is shunted through time. Fearghas fires a 7th-level Magic Missile on Plex, who becomes the first goblin in history to look down the barrel of a minigun. He drops and reappears outside the arena as Fearghas is BEAMING. He does not care about winning.</p><p>Round change! Kyrin - 2 / Naami - 7</p><p>Aviana feels kinda stuck in the Wall of Force. She offers a <strong>Bugman's Ale</strong> to Emilio so he can be immune to fear and they can have their 1v1. She asks that I drop the Wall of Force. I ask if she has a good plan. She says no, but she has a plan. I drop the Wall of Force. She bear-hugs Emilio, then drop-kicks Kyrin, punting her all the way to Antartica.</p><p>Emilio insulted my damage. So I take off my spellwards and pull radiant power into myself. \"I am a healer, but…\" and I fire a 9th-level <strong>Guiding Bolt</strong>. Emilio moves his head to the side, dodging at the cost of a strand of hair. Tee-hee, that was intentional of course, I didn't <em>really</em> want to hurt you. My spell shoots into the sky like a second sun, woops? Ezeriel bonks Emilio, and he reappears outside the arena.</p><p>Shalkoc reappears, confused. Me too, buddy, me too. He goes to Turtle Stance, and fails the save against Aviana's fear. Kyrin also fails her save, but she is a Rogue so she screws the rules and shoots at Fearghas. Emilio runs towards us and casts <strong>Void Torrent</strong> on all of us inside the circle. Everyone but me passes the save, owwie. He teleports into the circle.</p><p>Plex casts <strong>Jim's Magic Missile</strong>, creating TWENTY twisting, whistling, hypoallergenic, gluten-free darts of magical force to pepper us all. Alas, he gets greedy and the missiles explode in his face. But Emilio uses a <strong>Dreamfeather</strong>, allowing him to reroll! And it's not a nat 1! Thanks to Plex' <strong>Gravity Well</strong>, he pushes Fearghas, Aviana, Ezeriel, and myself out of the circle! And a free Crushing Impact on Fearghas to slap him down because he can. He Fey Steps to the East… just short of the circle. The missiles are too much for Fearghas, who reappears outside the arena.</p><p>Fearghas faces a dilemma. Teleport into the circle and win the game? Or blast the ever-living hell out of Plex? Fearghas chooses violence in the form of a 5th-level <strong>Scorching Ray</strong> on Plex, who responds with Temporal Shunt.</p><p>\"Why is Shalkoc 200 feet in the air?!\" - Karnack</p><p>\"Oh sorry I forgot to put him down.\" - Aerelia</p><p>Anyways, that's a Magic Mirror from Fearghas, and 5 of his Scorching Rays hit, 2 of them crits. He burns Plex to a crisp, causing him to reappear outside the arena. Emilio is alone in the circle, and the game ends in a tie. Fearghas has earned the biggest victory of his life.</p><p>\"Best funeral ever!\" - Plex, who was killed twice in the scuffle.</p><p>Ezeriel commends us on not holding back, even against our own friends. Oh, if he knew the thoughts that went through Fearghas' head. Aviana distributes Bugman's Ale. Shalkoc's bodyguards gently say we should return to <strong>Treshhold</strong>, now that we have done what we were allowed here to do. We get back there in the middle of the night, about 3am. We return to the inn and shuffle to bed.</p><hr><p><strong>Thursday, 7</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> Decimus, 1497</strong></p><p><strong>Long rest</strong></p><p>Kyrin goes to the markets to buy a very specific item, the <strong>Painter's Plume</strong>. Emilio casually buys diamond dust. I (re)stock on spell components. We spend a day relaxing before our appointment in Axis in the early hours of Friday.</p><p>At dinner, Kyrin gives the Painter's Plume to Aviana. She immediately puts on the jewelry and turns her wings brilliant white like a angel's, with golden feathertips. She gives Kyrin a pair of heeled shoes in return. We turn in early, but as I am about to go to bed, Master Clementiel comes to ask me for a conversation. He looks unwell, we walk for a while and he asks me to tell him about <strong>Lioriel</strong>… the angel I found in the Sibriex lair before I met the party. I struggle to get the words out, but I tell him. He leads me to a statue that was built as a memorial to Lioriel, whom Clementiel reveals was his brother. The Staff of Power I carry… it was Lioriel's. He was a healer with a burning heart, blinding him to the risks. Much like me, he wasn't a combatant… When he heard the desperate prayers of mortals trapped in the lair, he flied to their aid.</p><p>Clementiel sees the same traits in me as he saw in his brother, and he wishes to guide me as he failed to guide Lioriel. Not by restraining and forbidding, but by guiding and steadying. He asks me to accept this guidance, in the form of the <strong>Angel's Grace</strong>, a robe of white and silver with immense power, most of it still dormant. If I accept the guidance and act accordingly, the robe's power will awaken. I am honoured to accept this gift… as Clementiel leaves, I remain by the statue for a little while, praying and meditating, feeling the shadows around my heart dissipating.</p><p>Shalkoc wakes us in the middle of the night, like 2:30am. Fearghas is not impressed by my resplendent white dress, but Aviana does draw attention to it, and shifts the colour of her wings to match my robe. I don't feel quite worthy, yet… I'm a little embarrassed. But… I had not realised how cold I had been inside, since Lioriel's death. There is such warmth, now.</p><p>We go to the <strong>armoury</strong> to get Shalkoc's magic items back. He gets a little pat on the head for behaving so well. Laurel says Shalkoc VASTLY exceeded his expectations. By doing nothing. Their expectations must have been somewhere in the Lower Planes at this point… Shalkoc is very pleased. The bodyguards collectively sigh.</p><p>We gather around and Fearghas casts Plane Shift. Our stomachs are pulled through our noses again! We arrive on the single layer of Mechanus, <strong>Axis</strong>. The realm effect, <strong>Clockwork Precision</strong>, will remove advantage/disadvantage and force our rolls to be as close to 10 as possible, before modifiers. Nice and smooth. Flatten curves. Nothing is random. It sure is interesting here though, endless cities within giant gears, everything moving in perfect sync. \"Don't even think about it, Plex,\" says the DM. (Well that's goblinist profiling now.) Each giant gear has its own gravity.</p><p>\"They probably have very advanced technology here,\" Aviana says, \"maybe we can use some of that for Promise!\"</p><p>\"Yeah we just need to kidnap the right people,\" Shalkoc says.</p><p>Just then, the ground quakes. I fall down, and find Plex, Shalkoc, and Emilio prone next to me. A titan topped by a castle took one step, tripping half of us. We finally look around, and find we are standing in a long hallway, right in front of gate <strong>C3H8</strong>. A <strong>Guardian Golem</strong>, its body inscribed with glowing blue runes, comes over to us, its movement unexpectedly dextrous. It greets us, and Fearghas gives our invitation from Claude. We state our full names, under threat of being kicked out. We also have to state our intent. Fearghas glares at us, especially at Shalkoc. \"Behave yourselves, and be careful what you say.\"</p><p>We walk along a bronze wall. It looks smooth from afar, but… it's engraved with tiny letters in every known language. It states all the <strong>laws</strong> of Mechanus… That wall is extremely long. There are very long guidelines on the topic of changing the colour of structures. That means no painting, Plex. Aviana, we know you are dense, but you are not a building. Shalkoc what do you mean there is no gravity, we've just been over that!</p><p>We enter a giant engine room. Out-of-character, for a <strong>locomotive</strong>. It starts moving! Like a wagon or cart, without any horses! And there are no mages around… But gods, it's loud. So much steam is coming from the exhaust pipes. Smooth ride, if loud. Fearghas casts Detect Magic, but there is barely any around… just for lighting lanterns. The engines aren't magical… how mysterious.</p><p>After a 10-mn ride, we ride across a gap between gears. I look down… factories and cities. A clockwork dragon! There are airships. Beaming with pride, Plex says it can only be the work of <strong>Flax</strong>. We arrive in a city of towering buildings… is this how a spiderling feels? Tiny and easily crushed… The Golem guides us through metal hallways. This is <strong>Brigh</strong>'s realm, the <strong>Citadel of Resplendent Clockwork</strong>. He leads us to a clockmaker, a servant of Brigh.</p><p>The light in the corridor suddenly goes red, sirens blare \"Attention. Anomaly detected. Containment procedure started.\" Emilio… senses other <strong>Voidborn</strong>. As we round a corner into an open courtyard, we spot FIVE <strong>void portals</strong>, much bigger than the one we closed in the Underdark. Out of all five at the same time, a single creature slithers out, all tentacles and glowing red eyes and maws.</p><p>\"It's basically the size of a gundam.\" - Emilio</p><p>Modrons flock to the portals to close them. Emilio looks delighted! And hungry…</p>"

On the roof to our right, something is swirling, twisting inward… then, we hear the shrieking. We spot 4 more <strong>portals</strong>, 2 straight ahead and 2 to our left. Tentacles with eyes exit the portal on the right…?! Emilio warns us, things are about to get <em>really</em> bad.</p><p>We roll <strong>initiative</strong>, with unusual results due to the realm effect. XM-7 requires assistance closing the portals, we all agree to protect him. Emilio says the big tentacly monster is a <strong>Mindwitness</strong>, and the best strategy for hunting them is… not being seen. Cool. It begins with eye rays; I resist the Fear Ray, Emilio resists the Stunning Ray, and Fearghas resists the Psychic Ray. Phew.</p><p>I cast a Twinned <strong>Death Ward</strong> on myself and XM-7. He appreciates the assistance, what a good bot. Then I use the Angel's Grace's power to cast <strong>Sanctuary</strong> on myself, and retreat to the back lines. Emilio says he's going to turn off the lights, and 1.2 second later he casts <strong>Dying of the Light</strong>. T-thanks for the heads up, but next time, a little sooner?! As mentioned, everything goes pitch black. I hear XM-7 say Target acquired, and adds details on the closest voidgate, then takes off towards it. Emilio follows the flying robot, he is the only one who can see in the darkness.</p><p>Fearghas is grumbling at Emilio that he \"cannae bloody see\". He casts <strong>Fireball</strong> blindly, protecting XM-7 from the blast. There is some mad sizzling. \"Sounds like unhappy shadow calamari\" - Kyrin. Fearghas goes off muttering about humans seeing in the dark, and how he can see through darkness but not <strong>magical</strong> darkness grrrmmmmmbl.</p><p>We hear the scuttling of tiny feet coming our way. A <em>lot</em> of tiny feet… Kyrin fires an arrow; from the thud, she hits something. She hides, but that's okay we couldn't see her anyway. Emilio says the Mindwitness is hovering <strong>right above him</strong>, which causes the aberration to spot him and attack! Emilio's magic snipes it with necrotic damage and exhaustion. This also slaps a second Mindwitness! I quietly use <strong>Piercing the Veil</strong>, and tiptoe away from the closest monster, trying to get in a good position to keep an eye on everyone.</p><p><strong>THERE ARE NO WILD MAGIC SURGES IN MECHANUS!!</strong></p><p>Fearghas wants to move in.</p><p>Emilio casts <strong>Howling Horrors</strong>, producing an ear-splitting screech and dealing some juicy psychic damage. There is a revolting sound of something rotting bursting, as one of the Mindwitnesses dies and falls from the height it was hovering at. XM-7 reaches the portal on the roof and casually <strong>closes</strong> it. He used his left arm which rotated quickly and produced a beam of bluish light that shot into the portal and shrunk it until it winked out. Yeah… I have no idea how to do that myself. But Emilio seems inspired?</p><p>Emilio senses a shuddering of pain as XM-7 fires into the portal. He thinks it's just like a caster dropping concentration on a spell. These small portals, unlike the one we saw in the Underdark, are not stabilised and held open; they're being kept open by, Emilio assumes, a creature on the other side. So some voidborn can just <strong>open portals to other planes</strong> and let bullshit through. Lovely.</p><p>Fearghas fires (hehe) a <strong>Ray of Frost</strong> on a Minion and obliterates it. He shouts there are more enemies this way. He then gets \"tentacled\". Why'd you have to use this word, I've seen enough… hens wearing ties to know where this is going. Emilio's spell slaps the minions all the way into next week as they instantly die to the necrotic energy. He guides Kyrin to the closest monster, and she shoots at it.</p><p>We hear sloppy sloshing noises as more things spill out of the portals. We need to get XM-7 to close them asap! Another sickening sound as a second Mindwitness succumbs to Emilio's magic. I follow after XM-7, looking for the closest portal, and summon <strong>Fade</strong> in the idea to have her flank enemies so Kyrin can shoot them better. Emilio casts a <strong>Blade Ward</strong> on himself, and yells to XM-7 to head north, he was a lost bot. XM-7 locates one of the portals, on the roof of the building in front of us! Fade feels her way up the stairs and hunts by sound, camping next to one of the portals. She goes invisible, hoping to bite anything that comes her way. She might let Emilio pat her head, since they both want to nibble on voidborn?</p><p>Fearghas is DONE with the darkness and puts on his <strong>Glasses of True Seeing</strong>. He goes northwest to the left of the building, looking for a portal to point XM-7 to. Kyrin moves her \"happy butt\" close to Emilio, as he is, in her words, her \"seeing dog\". He points an enemy to her, far to the east. She takes the shot, but narrowly misses.</p><p>As round 4 begins, Emilio feels the air ripple and the portals… <strong>stabilising</strong>. He warns us about this, adding he has a bad feeling about this and we need to close the portals like <em>now</em>. I dash up the stairs and spot three of the portals! I do my best to aim XM-7 to the nearest portal. Kyrin tugs Emilio's robe to wish him luck; he apologises about leaving her as he dashes up the stairs, and says he sees a lot more Mindwitnesses and minions… and a <strong>Warped</strong> <strong>Seer</strong>. Ah shit, here we go again.</p><p>Our brobot XM-7 closes the portal by the roof with his beam! Emilio recognises the entity beyond the portal as he feels its pain from this portal in front of him… and the portal behind him, too. It is <strong>one single big voidborn</strong> holding all the portals open, that is TROUBLE.</p><p>Fade leaps off the roof, taking minor fall damage despite landing on her shadowy paws. She prowls at the edge of Emilio's spell and takes the <strong>Dodge</strong> action, hoping for minions to come within attack-of-opportunity range. Fearghas looks into the western void portal… Immediately, he knows he <em>should not</em> keep looking. He only glimpses a mass of teeth, tentacles, and eyes. \"We all know the old wall of flesh!\" Karnack says happily. Eek. Fearghas shouts IMMA FIRIN' MAH SPHERRRRRE and casts <strong>Otiluke's Freezing Sphere</strong>. The voidborn freeze with a sound of tinkling glass, crystallised with frost. This draws the minions of course, who scuttle towards him.</p><p>The <strong>Seer</strong> all the way to the northeast starts blasting. Fearghas is saved by the realm effect, which causes the first two <strong>Psychic Orbs</strong> to miss. He casts <strong>Shield</strong> to block the third one. Emilio's magic casually murders 4 other minions. Kyrin says \"Come and get me!\" which confuses XM-7 for a moment, until Emilio directs him to the western portal Fearghas is standing close to. She <em>cunningly</em> dashes up to between Emilio and me. He points out the nearest enemies to her, allowing her to plant an arrow in a Mindwitness.</p><p>Round 5 starts. All eyes are on Fearghas, and believe me, there are a LOT of those. He saves against a Psychic Ray, a Fear Ray, and a Stunning Ray — barely. All the eyes <em>narrow</em>, and their owner skedaddles. The exact same thing happens a second time with another Mindwitness. Oh they're mad. I aim at the Seer with Lioriel's Staff, and blast off a <strong>Magic Missile</strong>… at 1st level. Woops… It tickles the Seer. I hear it giggle in my mind. Uuuuuuurrrrrgh.</p><p>Fearghas is hit by a <strong>Slowing Ray</strong> and a <strong>Telekinetic Ray</strong>. He is restrained and dragged towards a pit by a Mindwitness. Emilio goes into Void Form and becomes unable to concentrate on Dying of the Light. He teleports with Phase Shift, and starts blasting.</p><p>\"Are we seriously trying to figure out the air speed velocity of a dwarf?\" - Kyrin</p><p>Fearghas falls into the pit, Wile E. Coyote style. Oh no! Anyway. The Mindwitnesses are looking very smug, so Emilio assures them, and Fearghas, that the aberrations will be next. He gets blasted with eye rays for his trouble, and gets <strong>stunned</strong>. Because of this he cannot save on the Telekinetic Ray and gets restrained too, allowing the Mindwitness to drag him to the edge of the pit.</p><p>XM-7 closes the western portal. The voidborn on the other side gets angry, Emilio says… It <em>wants</em> to come here. Oh my. Fade runs up to a Mindwitness and has herself a little crunch, then a big crunch, killing the thing.</p><p>Fearghas: \"Ooooooooaaaaaahaohohohohooooo… bloody humans. <strong>Dimension Door</strong>!\"</p><p>He's fine, just grumpy. He asks XM-7 how to close the portals. The Golem starts rattling out some kind of equation. \"In Common!\" Fearghas requests, to no avail. Emilio is getting his nice bottom handed to him. That's a shame. The Seer joins in and blasts him while he is struggling. That's a lot of damage! It scuttles towards Fearghas.</p><p>Suddenly, Antagonize. The DM does not know how it got here. We struggle for a minute; it was on the Rogue's Mantle all this time. Well that was weird. Kyrin then decides to shoot \"this little shit over there\".</p><p>Round 6 starts and… <strong>no new enemies</strong> appear. That's actually somehow more frightening…</p><p>I chuck a <strong>Fireball</strong> towards the Seer, detonating it in the air to 1) catch the Mindwitness and 2) spare Fearghas. He is very proud. The dead Mindwitness crashes splashingly to the floor and the Seer is not happy with me. I recast <strong>Sanctuary</strong> on myself, just in time, as a Mindwitness is giving me the evil eyes, a lot of them. Emilio is incapacitated.</p><p>I save against a Fear Ray, but Fearghas fails against the Telekinetic Ray and chucked into the pit. Again. Fade gives the Seer the good old crunch. As a reaction, it uses <strong>Bend Space</strong> and swaps places with a Mindwitness, so Fade crunches on that. SQUISH. It's disgusting and she bites very gingerly, inflicting minor damage. She uses <strong>Shadow Blend</strong> to become a very grumpy invisible shadow cat.</p><p>Fearghas <strong>Misty Step</strong>s out of the pit, then casts <strong>Disintegrate</strong> on the Seer. It saves and takes no damage! The Seer casts <strong>Collapse Distance</strong> on Emilio, teleporting him… INTO THE PIT. Toodaloo! Fearghas casts <strong>Feather Fall</strong> on him! The Seer looks back at the portal behind him… and jumps into the pit after Emilio. What?! He falls past Emilio who is falling in slow motion. Yoink! Attack of opportunity!</p><p>Kyrin aims at the Mindwitness, right into the teeth-holes left by Fade. Oh that is a lot of damage for an arrow.</p><p>Three new portals open. Out of FIVE portals flows a single creature… The portals all close after it. A towering creature stands before us, made of tentacles and parts of beasts, too many eyes, too many fangs. The body parts are all jumbled and howling. As that <strong>Greater Star Spawn Emissary</strong> comes out of the portal, it blasts an EMP wave that incapacitates XM-7. It spews out a wave of <strong>Unearthly Bile</strong>, which only Fade manages to dodge, sort of, she still takes half damage. For each failed save, a <strong>Choker</strong> spawns… cool, cool.</p><p>Now, the <strong>Emissary</strong> takes its turn. All the bullshit before was just reaction! It decides Fearghas is the biggest threat, and one of its maws rushes towards him. Fearghas dodges, so the Emissary shoots 2 <strong>Psychic Orbs</strong> at him. It slaps an Eyeless Void on Kyrin's position, an area of magical darkness…</p><p>I keep it together, and whisper to the darkness, making shadows converge on the Emissary. I have to recast <strong>Sanctuary</strong> after that, running out of charges but it might save my life! Emilio bursts out of the pit with Void Torrent. He walks up to me, and crunches on his shards to apply <strong>Accrued Vitality</strong>. Very prudent, approved.</p><p>The Emissary uses 2 legendary actions on <strong>Warp Space</strong>, making the ground below Emilio and me a mass of teeth and maws! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. Fade tries to opportunistically crunch at a Mindwitness, but remembering how slimy and disgusting they are, she hesitates and the attack misses. Don't blame ya, kitty. The Mindwitness takes a look at Fearghas, a lot of looks really… He takes a Fear Ray and is now quaking in his boots.</p><p>Fade gives the Emissary the good crunch, presumably it tastes better, then she slips into the shadows. The Emissary is immune to prone, of course… Fearghas casts another <strong>Otiluke's Freezing Sphere</strong>, ignoring all allies. The foul-tasting Mindwitness dies, and the little minions are wiped out as well. Then he summons his axe with <strong>Spiritual Weapon</strong>. And the big pile of void bullshit is resistant to <strong>Force</strong> damage, welp. Sad Warlock noises.</p><p>Kyrin does a <strong>Psychic Teleportation</strong> out of the magical darkness and drops down on the Emissary, slashing with the <strong>Sun Blade</strong>. Fade's flanking grants her <strong>Sneak Attack</strong> priviledges! She marks the soul in the bargain.</p><p>The Emissary saves on my <strong>Living Shadows</strong>, and casually walks out of the aoe… Come on. It casts <strong>Eyeless Void</strong> to slap more magical darkness on Kyrin, Fearghas, and Fade. From inside the darkness, it chucks three Psychic Orbs at Emilio, inflicting heavy damage. He's standing right next to me, so I remove my spellwards and channel Cure Wounds, heightened to 8th-level, on Emilio. The maws below our feet disappeared, phew.</p><p>The Emissary unleashes a <strong>Mind Cloud</strong>, inflicting spicy psychic damage on Fearghas, Kyrin, and Fade. Emilio speaks the command word of his cloak, and casts <strong>Blight</strong> on the big guy, but it resists <strong>necrotic</strong> damage! The Emissary burns another legendary action to attack Fade, and kills her. Fearghas casts <s>the bad touch</s> <strong>Withering Touch</strong> and tries to inflict Curse of Fragility, but the Emissary burns a legendary resistance.</p><p>\"It's a shame the Curse of Impotence doesn't make all his tentacles go limp…\" Kyrin</p><p>Fearghas chugs a <strong>Potion of Supreme Healing</strong> and shimmies around so he is perfectly flanking the Emissary. Kyrin slashes with the Sun Blade. Unsurprisingly, the Emissary is resistant to <strong>psychic</strong> damage as well. It lets out a very angry… squelch. (Karnack makes murlock noises) She slaps a <strong>Psychic Blade</strong> into it for good measure.</p><p>The Emissary uses its 4th legendary action to recharge its <strong>Unearthly Bile</strong>… and it immediately starts it turn afterwards, so it pukes out the bile. Kyrin dodges and takes zero. Emilio is immune thanks to his cloak! The Emissary is, of course, immune to acid. Hey, you never know. It then shoots Emilio with the Psychic Orbs, and all three hit! He is still standing, but barely…</p><p>I upcast <strong>Wellspring of Life</strong> to 7th-level and slap it down at my feet and Emilio's. The Emissary teleports INTO IT and attacks Emilio… Vittuperkelesaatanaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. The Wellspring heals Emilio a little bit although I roll like concentrated essence of ASS. It's enough for Emilio, who walks up to the Emissary and starts slicing. He pops an essence shard on <strong>Accrued Vitality</strong>… and for a second his claws resist his will. Surprise quickly fades as his face takes on a look of \"Oh… it's like <em>that</em>.\" He consumes 5 essence shards for a free <strong>Eldritch Blast</strong>, and finishes off the Emissary!</p><p>Emilio's gauntlets turn pitch black, absorbing light. His shadow extends, dragging the Emissary back to where it came from, leaving not even a corpse or a drop of blood. He stands with a look of immense satisfaction on his face, then lays down with a wide happy grin on his face.</p><p>We <strong>level up</strong> to 14!! UNLIMITED POWAAAAAAAAAAAH</p><p>I question Emilio on what he did with the body. He very naturally replies \"I ate it. We hunt, we eat, we get stronger. That's how it goes, no?\" Fearghas grumbles because he wanted to harvest the body for alchemical components, presumably. The dwarf asks… \"Is this what happened to the Hag? Is that why you freaked out when Naami touched you?\" Emilio goes quiet, and nods. Then he explains it's different, because she wasn't voidborn. I sit down in shock. An entire conversation suddenly makes a LOT of sense…</p><p>XM-7 gets back up and says \"Threat can no longer be detected. Expecting report.\" And then he arrests Fearghas for \"tampering with evidence\". Fearghas protests… XM-7 has no sense of self, it seems. We very frustratingly try to explain we did nothing wrong, and we saved the place from a void incursion, but XM-7 cannot compute and repeats we violated a law. The fine for tampering with evidence… is three days of community service polishing clockwork wheels.</p><p>I ask XM-7 if he is okay. He says yes, in robot speak, and that my care is appreciated. Some more stomping occurs as robots from the <strong>forensics</strong> team show up. They ask us a lot of questions about what happened <em>exactly</em>. We spent FIVE HOURS reporting, omitting only the Emissary… At least we did it while standing in the Wellspring of Life and we get healed to full. Fearghas gets to harvest his alchemical components, but since he still broke a law, the robots insist on him doing the 36 hours community service polishing brass cogs within the next 7 days, which prompts a healthy amount of grumbling.</p><p>\"Please follow for audience with <strong>Master Artificer Kazzim-Aleph-1</strong>\" XM-7 says, and stomps away. He leads us to a workshop, from which comes an irritated (?) beeping, and then unsteady steps, like a drunk man walking with a cane. The figure which opens the door is a good bit taller than Shalkoc, cloaked in red, and wears a clockwork mask that reveals an organic, humanoid eye. Mechanical appendages poke out from under the cloak. (Imagine a steampunk tech priest, Aerelia says.) It asks with a high-pitched, squeaky voice, whether we are the mortals he was told to expect.</p><p>He is one of the Master Artificers in service of <strong>Brigh</strong>. We are… expected to enter, not welcome, and we are not to touch anything inside. He makes it clear that he'd rather spend his time with anything else than \"fleshlings\". I say that's rude. He says we just haven't been blessed with the resplendence of clockwork. We enter, sit down, and the Artificer says \"You are about to lose my interest, try to spark it.\" Sigh.</p><p>Fearghas brings up the <strong>Beacon of Doom</strong>, and Kyrin pulls it out and explains its function. She also explains wearily that we helped defend this place, but got community service for it… Kazzim-Aleph says that if we don't break any laws, we don't get punished. I say it's impossible for mortals like us to know all the laws of Mechanus… \"Have you considered replacing your body with resplendent clockwork?\" Eeeeeegh…</p><p>He picks up the Beacon of Doom and his cogs start turning real fast. He wants to study it. He will look at it in his workshop for a bit, while his apprentice entertains us. We say we need to leave with the artifact in a couple days. \"That is tragic,\" he says and scampers away with the Beacon, shouting for his apprentice <strong>Kess Al'dín</strong>. A female voice replies; Kazzim-Aleph dismissively tells her to have \"meaningless conversations\" with us.</p><p>We see a… devil's wing pop up, immediately followed by the rest of a winged Tiefling in a steampunk outfit, with the marks of goggles around her eyes. She is very curious about the artifact, so Kyrin gives a short explanation. Emilio chimes in, explaining how he pissed off <strong>Zariel</strong>. I say it's a long story, and may we please have some tea? She conjures up a flame with her finger, looking very proud of herself, then sheepishly says her master doesn't approve of that since she burnt down the library, once.</p><p>Kess says she applied for an apprenticeship, and she has been here for 6 years. She doesn't get to talk to people often, and those aren't really fulfilling conversations. I sort of challenge Kess to think about how to get <strong>Zariel</strong> to sell us back our friends' souls. She tries but quickly gets stumped, and we end up talking about people, logic, numbers, structure… and Fearghas' community service.</p><p>Kess asks why we are so pressed by time. We've got things to do, places to be… we're involved in wars, the time schedule is tight, and more voidborn are appearing. She is confused but no less curious. She shows us a piece of clockwork on her thigh… I ask her to explain. She talks about… not having time for things like <em>dying</em>. Kyrin asks about the mind, and the soul, and identity. Kess hasn't figured out how to convert the <strong>mind and soul</strong> to clockwork.</p><p>I ask Kess if her body doesn't reject the clockwork. She says of course it does, she just numbs it. She shows us a needle in her leg, dosing her with <strong>painkillers</strong>… It makes me so sad… Emilio discusses the similarities with his half-voidborn body. Kess is really intrigued, so Emilio tells her about the Void. Kess sees <strong>logic</strong> in the Void, a law in \"eat or be eaten\". She wants to go there. Emilio is trying to explain she will die… at best.</p><p>Kess is a little confused about why we are here, if we are so bad with law. We explain we need help with law. She explains to Fearghas that he is lucky; the law he broke here, <strong>Lady Brigh</strong> is very lenient with it. On other gears, he would have been killed outright. Apparently, there is a lot of \"chaos\" on this gear. Oooooooooh dear. One of Lady Brigh's teachings is chaos is necessary for innovation. Kyrin pulls out her <strong>Echo Stone</strong>, which says \"Oh, I have this echo rock\" after Kyrin said it. Kess is FASCINATED. She wants to build something similar out of clockwork, so she can record her ideas and she doesn't have to remember them!</p><p>Fearghas is eager to get done with his community service, and goes out. \"Aight, XM-7, take me to the cogs.\" Before he leaves, he casts <strong>Rary's Telepathic Bond</strong> to stay in touch with us. Kess offers us to look through the catalogue of \"things Master can craft\". The moment she mentions a \"<strong>Tome of Clear Thought</strong>\", we hear from outside the door… tap tap tap… taptaptapTAPTAPTAP<strong>TAPTAPTAPTAPTAP </strong>and Fearghas appears asking about the tome. He is told off by XM-7 because he has to go polish cogs instead of running off… There is also talk of an <strong>Ioun Stone of Mastery</strong> (increases Proficiency Bonus by 1) and a legendary +2 dagger that poisons its target, <strong>Asp's Kiss</strong>.</p><p>Specific ingredients are needed to craft these items… a petrified <strong>Pit Fiend</strong>'s eye for the stone (it must be petrified <em>before</em> it dies), a poisoned poison gland of a <strong>Yuan-Ti</strong> <strong>Anathema</strong> (they are immune to poison) for the dagger, and the still-dreaming brain of an <strong>Aboleth</strong> for the tome. For this we need to extract the brain without waking or killing the big fish. All of the brain. We hyperfocus on the brain and lack of <strong>nose-holes</strong>, and discuss theories. Kess interjects those ingredients have been on the list for a very long time and nobody has managed to provide them. Yeah, I wonder why.</p><p>We speak to Kazzim about the <strong>contract</strong> with Zariel. He suggests to have the signing of the new contract happen on neutral ground, i.e. Mechanus. Essentially we sneak the Beacon into <strong>Dis</strong>, then go to Mechanus, and <strong>blackmail</strong> Zariel to come to Mechanus and sign, or we activate the Beacon in Dis and she gets big shit from <strong>Dispater</strong>. We also need to have the person who carries the Beacon under constant live surveilance from Mechanus until they bring the Beacon back there to trade it back to Zariel. Phew, my shift key worked overtime on this paragraph.</p><p>We discuss the cost of descending to Dis through the Bronze Citadel in Avernus… Probably a very steep cost, like 5000 gold per person, one way, from Avernus into Dis. Well, back to the idea of the <strong>Black Vents</strong>. We'll also need to reveal it to Dispater so he knows to blame Zariel. A time constraint on Zariel would help us.</p><p><strong>Plan of attack</strong>:</p><p>We go to Avernus, descend into Dis through the Black Vents, set up camp in Dis with the Beacon. We send a message to Zariel telling her to <s>get thine arse</s> get her fiery bum to Mechanus or we blow up the thing and she gets mad shit from Dispater.</p><p>Kazzim suggests to have Mechanus officials contact Zariel, because they don't lie. Fearghas asks who we need to talk to for this kind of support. <strong>Control Court MH4</strong>; we can get an appointment with them through XM-7, probably. The Modrons will help us with the details, i.e. facilitate the contract. Our job is to get the Beacon to Dis for blackmailing purposes, and then take it back to Mechanus to exchange it for our friends' souls. Fearghas asks about the location of a teleportation circle in Mechanus where we can meet up.</p>"

Yet another! <strong>Five</strong> in total! Brobot politely requests assistance to close the portals. Emilio kindly informs us that the big monster, all tentacles and eyes, is called a Mindwitness and the best strategy to hunt it is… not being seen. It blasts us with eye rays, so there goes the plan.</p>\n<p>Emilio says he's going to turn off the lights, but we're in initiative and 1.2 second later he casts <strong>Dying of the Light</strong>, plunging us all into magical darkness. Fearghas grumbles he \"cannae bloody see\" and mutters heartily about humans. We fight blindly and make an <em>enlightening</em> discovery!</p>\n<p><strong>THERE ARE NO WILD MAGIC SURGES IN MECHANUS!!</strong></p>\n<p>Fearghas wants to move in.</p>\n<p>XM-7 closes a portal by shooting it. Emilio senses something from beyond the portal, a lot like losing concentration on a spell. We theorise the portals are unstable and held open by a void mage, so we better hurry! Aerelia uses the phrase \"get tentacled\" and my mind is filled with images of female chickens wearing neckties. Is this psychic damage? Both Fearghas and me find ways to see through the darkness, but poor Kyrin needs to be guided by her seeing dog Emilio, who points her at enemies like a gun.</p>\n<p>We can't be too mad because Emilio's spell easily drops the small minions. The fight is a breeze, until he feels the portals stabilising and a <strong>Warped Seer</strong> gets through. Fearghas is hearing the trees speak Deep Speech. We point XM-7 at the portals because we have no idea how to close them ourselves. Emilio senses there is <strong>only one entity</strong> holding all those portals open. Fearghas takes a peep into a void portal, decides it's a bad idea as the old Wall of Flesh peeps back.</p>\n<p>\"IMMA FIRIN' MAH SPHERRRRRRRRE\" - Fearghas casting <strong>Otiluke's Freezing Sphere</strong></p>\n<p>I somewhat accidentally chuck a 1st-level Magic Missile at the Seer.

Coyote style.</p>\n<p>\"Are we seriously trying to figure out the air speed velocity of a dwarf?\" - Kyrin</p>\n<p>I make Fearghas very proud with the simple use of <strong>Fireball</strong>. Fearghas is chucked into the pit again, may or may not have been Emilio's fault. Then Emilio is chucked into the pit, and the Seer jumps in after him. But Emilio got a <strong>Feather Fall</strong> courtesy of Fearghas, so not only does the Seer zoom past him, Emilio gets an attack of opportunity.</p>\n<p>Three new portals open to let through a generous serving of nightmare fuel, teeth and eyes and tentacles aplenty. The <strong>Greater Star Spawn Emissary</strong> blasts an EMP wave that knocks out Brobot! Then it vomits on us a lot.</p>\n<p>Magical darkness is slapped on Kyrin but she teleports out, slashing with the Sun Blade! My shadow cat gives her <strong>Sneak Attack</strong> privileges by flanking the big thing. Fearghas gives the boss the bad touch, which is <strong>Withering Touch</strong>.</p>\n<p>\"It's a shame the Curse of Impotence doesn't make all his tentacles go limp.\" - Kyrin</p>\n<p>Karnack makes excellent murloc noises. We get puked on again, and the Emissary gives Emilio a lot of side eyes because he is immune to acid. Kyrin is not immune, but she does the <em>sick dodges</em>. Emilio is next to me, getting focused and taking a beating, so I cast Wellspring of Life at our feet. The Emissary teleports INTO IT and attacks Emilio… Vittuperkelesaatanaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. I roll on healing like concentrated essence of ASS. Emilio looks at the Emissary, looks at his claws, smirks. \"Oh… it's like <em>that</em>.\" And he finishes off the boss with an Eldritch Blast as a BONUS ACTION?!</p>\n<p>Emilio eats the boss. He is now very happy and ready to take a nap.</p>\n<p>We level up to 14!</p>\n<p>Fearghas and Emilio have words. I hug the Staff of Power for emotional support because my cat got murdered. Fearghas harvests alchemical components and gets arrested for tampering with evidence, sentenced to 3 days polishing gears.</p>\n<p>Five hours later we get to leave the crime scene. XM-7 has rebooted and he leads us to a workshop where we meet Master Artificer, <strong>Kazzim-Aleph-1</strong>. He is a very impatient person whose body seems mostly mechanical, he calls us \"fleshlings\". We show him the Beacon of Doom, he loves it and wants it for study. Fine then, just for a few days. He grabs it and disappears downstairs with it, leaving us to talk with his apprentice, <strong>Kess</strong>.</p>\n<p>A winged Tiefling, Kess is very happy to be talking to people for once. She's started to turn her body into clockwork, using lots of painkillers in the process. We talk about a lot of things, Kess wants to visit the Void, we try to explain it's not exactly good for tourism this season. Fearghas leaves to start polishing cogs. Kess mentions items her master can craft; an <strong>Ioun Stone of Mastery</strong>, the poison dagger <strong>Asp's Kiss</strong>, and a <strong>Tome of Clear Thought</strong>.</p>\n<p>The last one has Fearghas rushing back in. These items need very specific materials; a petrified <strong>Pit Fiend</strong>'s eye, a <em>poisoned</em> poison gland of a <strong>Yuan-Ti Anathema</strong>, and the still-dreaming brain of an <strong>Aboleth</strong>. We have a deep conversation about how to procure the brain. Kyrin happily suggests we extract it through the nose-holes. We do a quick research and realise… Aboleths don't have any nose-holes!</p>\n<p>We are stumped. Fearghas takes it personally.</p>\n<p>Kazzim gives very good advice about our predicament with Zariel, and with the help of Mechanus we now have a solid <strong>plan of attack</strong>!</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sneak the Beacon into Dis.</li>\n<li>Tell Mechanus to contact Zariel.</li>\n<li>Get the Beacon back to Mechanus and exchange it to Zariel for our friends' souls!</li>\n<li>???</li>\n<li>Profit!</li>\n</ol>"

We have 3 days on our hands while Fearghas is polishing gears and Master Kazzim is studying the Beacon. I argue with Aviana; we should <strong>study</strong> <strong>air</strong> <strong>travel</strong> to keep Promise aloft, instead of working enslaved air elementals to death! Fearghas feels a disturbance in the Force. He wants to build a <strong>life support machine</strong> for just the brain, as Master Kazzim would be very upset if we brought the entire fish. Kess says this kind of machine would be really difficult to make, even for master artificers, and the apparatus would have to be tuned to the Aboleth specifically.</p><p>Looks like trading here is mostly done in <strong>Clockwork Looking Glasses</strong>, a currency of which 1 is equal to… 1618.03gp. How golden-ly specific. We can trade gold for them. The looking glasses are also a one-use item with really interesting effects! Truly a metaphysical experience.</p><p>We find a workshop painted in odd colours, which seems about to close. It was the workshop of the recently deceased master Artificer <strong>Daretti</strong>, a goblin who had Brigh's favour. He passed away after… testing one of his invention. It is heavily implied the goblin blew himself up all the way into the neighbouring gear by way of a rocket. Plex is impressed and needs one of those.</p><p>We discuss air travel in <strong>Hell</strong>, prompting a lot of chaos. Fearghas is getting a weird headache while polishing gears. Aviana is talking Plex into tying rockets to his legs, and suggests trading Shalkoc for the rockets, until she realises when kinda need Shalkoc for the whole poisoning thing. He casually suggests kidnapping people, which has every construct in the immediate vicinity creak as their heads ominously turn towards us. Ha ha no we were not being serious, of course. You see we were just in <strong>Heaven</strong> and we were not allowed to lie, so we thought we should tell a silly lie just to be funny.</p><p>The robots are very amused with us. Shalkoc and Plex want to open up a shop in <strong>Axis</strong>, and I cannot understand why. Aviana does the math on how much the Rocketbelt would cost in gold (3237). We could rent out a <strong>vending machine</strong>, slap it down in Promise, and use it to <strong>trade with Mechanus</strong>. Honestly, that would be fire, let's go! Turns out to get a vending machine, we need to go to a vending machine that vends vending machines. Plex is already calculating how to scam the vending machine. I fear we may be polishing gears for a while…</p><p>We can get 7 vending machines for 1 looking glass. We do some math, which ends in Shalkoc saying to Plex \"Anyway, are you taking the gold or not?\". Plex tries to negotiate, borrows money from Shalkoc for his <strong>Rocketboots</strong>, and we decide to rent the 7 vending machines and decide later what to do about all these vending machines. Aviana suggests using the anchor chain to go get some money from Promise, which according to Kess, is legal as long as we do it in the designated teleport area.</p><p>Fearghas takes a break from polishing gears to go tell us all off. Turns out Emilio has big monies! Plex buys 2 looking glasses and trades them for \"a chance to soar in the sky with a rocket strapped to his side\". In these terms. Aviana buys a looking glass and is now absolutely broke, the entirety of her monetary wealth reduced to 2 silver pieces.</p><p>We find a shop selling \"height compensation devices\", that is very thin stilts, as demonstrated by a gnome now taller than Shalkoc. He pulls out a long trumpet and says \"Welcome to my shop! I am <strong>Arondriemus Hupperdook Tinkertop</strong>.\" He also sells <s>guns</s> hand crossbows with a 10-bolt magazine; the Tinkertop Boltblaster 1000.</p><p>Another shop sells <strong>spell scrolls</strong>, so we of course lose Fearghas. He is frantically looking for potions to sell so he can buy scrolls, but there is very little interest in potions on this plane of existence, most inhabitants are machines… He sells unneeded scrolls to purchase other scrolls and copy the spells into his <strong>spellbook</strong>. Fearghas also buys the Tinkertop Boltblaster 1000 for Kyrin.</p><p>We finish shopping! Fearghas furiously polishes gears for 3 more days. Kess kindly lets us sleep in her room.</p><hr><p><strong>Monday, 11</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> of Decimus, 1497</strong></p><p><strong>14:45</strong></p><p><strong>Short rest</strong></p><p>We make ready to return to <strong>Avernus</strong> and scout out the <strong>Black Vents</strong>. Combat mode on. We go over the hearsay and legends we have on the area… it is not reassuring at all. Master Kazzim returns the Beacon of Doom and says it has been made with the influence of <strong>Nethys</strong>, the god of magic. He believes it comes from, or was stolen, from Nethys' realm in Limbo, <strong>Ahkanefti</strong>. However, this realm has been sealed for a very long time! 1500 years or so? He isn't sure. He also doesn't think the Beacon is that old, it seems it was made using recent technology.</p><p>He mentions temples to Nethys underneath the <strong>Redwind Sands</strong> desert, massive structures built with magic. Maybe that civilisation isn't as dead as we thought… Aviana, Shalkoc, and Fearghas talk about Plex eating memories among giant trees in <strong>Jotunheim</strong>; one of these memories related to Ahkanefti.</p><p>Kazzim asks if he could keep the Beacon for just a few more days possibly…? Plex narrows his eyes at him, supposing he'd keep the Beacon forever if we let him. Plex and Aviana mutter back and forth in <s>the butt language</s> Sylvan. We firmly tell Kazzim he cannot keep the Beacon, so he asks if we have anything else like it. Fearghas pulls out a <strong>tiki mask</strong>, which sets Kazzim's remaining eye rolling so far it comes back a different colour. Plex pulls out a coconut, I mean a <strong>smoke grenade</strong>. Fearghas tries to retrieve the artifact. Kazzim is unwilling to let go. Plex is digging through his pack, pulling out traps of his own design. Surprisingly, though maybe not so much, Kazzim likes Plex and his ingenuity. He warns him to adjust experiments to his size. Guess he sees a bit of the late Daretti in Plex… shudder.</p><p><s>Emilio gives a long stare at a strange square of some kind of stone, muttering about his </s><strong><s>Book of Shadows</s></strong><s>. The stone is his book? I am very confused. The confusion spreads as we start talking about warlocks.</s></p><p>Plex wants to trade a trinket with Kazzim. He wants some time to think it through, while Plex is just winging it.</p><p>We discuss the logistics of plane travel, and Fearghas suggests a <strong>long rest</strong> before we go down to Hell.</p><p>\"We should build a brothel.\" - Aviana</p><p>Aerelia rolls a bunch of hidden dice which makes us all plenty nervous, so we call him out on it.</p><p>Before taking a rest, Fearghas does some spellscribing and alchemy while inspired by Aviana's glorious flexing. I cast a 9th-level <strong>Remove Curse</strong> on myself to undo 2 major surges. Fearghas and Plex copy into their spellbooks: <strong>Catapult</strong>, <strong>Flawed Design</strong>, <strong>Fly</strong>, and <strong>Scrying</strong>. Aviana wants to tinker with Kyrin's shoes or my shoes, to try and hide a small blade in them. Because she loves our feet. Uh, that sounds wrong but okay.</p><p>Aviana gives me a shoe with a <strong>secret blade</strong>. I give her a cookie for it. Then Shalkoc says he still has chocolate. I happily suggest we kindly ask to borrow a kitchen somewhere, and use the chocolate… to make better cookies! We are both thrilled.</p><hr><p><strong>Tuesday, 12</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> of Decimus, 1497</strong></p><p><strong>15:45</strong></p><p><strong>Long rest </strong>(next long rest on Saturday, 16th Decimus)</p><p>Kyrin writes and sketches in her journal about our recent adventures.</p><p>The gear we are on, Brigh's domain, has 2 sides. She believes that order and chaos are needed for innovation, and therefore is very tolerant of planar travellers (called \"variables\"). They live on the <strong>downside</strong> of the gear, and have created imitations of natural landscapes. On the <strong>upside</strong> of the gear, dedicated to absolute order, constructs live and calculate every little thing.</p><p>There are no clouds nor rain in Axis, and the temperature is always exactly 23.1406°C. This is also oddly specific, more secrets of math. Air currents remain very localised.</p><p>I research the <strong>painkillers</strong> living creatures use here, hoping for useful substances, and I am horrified… their painkillers are so strong, they just cause necrosis and nobody cares, because they just replace the fleshy parts with clockwork. To take my mind off this horrible discovery, I go bake cookies with Shalkoc. We save them for desserts as he cooks <strong>meals</strong> for all of us. Rhubard pie for Fearghas (yes rhubard with a d, I don't think that was intentional but I love it, the rhubarb of bards), Stir-fried rice with chicken for Aviana, Eggs and sausage for me, Grilled ribs for Emilio, Meat sandwich for Plex, Fried fish for himself, and a luxurious Chai Latte for Kyrin.</p><p>Then, Plex casts his new spell <strong>Planetrotting</strong> to take us all to Avernus. It does not go well. IT DOES NOT GO WELL!! Everything smells of swamp-rot. We all get irrationally angry with Plex. Oh… oh no. We are in <strong>Muravelara</strong>. We hear a weird howling in the distance! Aviana cries, why are we in a SWAAAAAMP?! and shoves Plex. Fearghas casts <strong>Guidance</strong> on Plex, and starts the ritual casting of <strong>Leomund's Tiny Hut</strong>. This is gonna be 10 long minutes.</p><p>Kyrin, Shalkoc, Aviana, and Emilio are looking out for threats. Plex is getting started on another Planetrotting. I try to stay calm and begin ritually casting <strong>Augury</strong>, ready to interrupt it if anything threatens the two wizards. Naturally, our friends are rolling Perception checks… under the Blood Moon's Spite realm effect… Shalkoc fails the check.</p><p>Kyrin figures out a pattern to the very creepy <strong>footsteps</strong> in the mud, which always sound like they are right behind us until we turn around, and there is nothing. She pretends to turn around… ha, gotcha! One of the trees has moved… and we roll initiative.</p><p>Kyrin moves away, and shoots… something with her bow, marking the soul (it's a Spriggan). Emilio says… \"I'm so sorry, Kyrin\". And casts <strong>Dying of the Light</strong>, and immediately after he grants us <strong>Gift of Eyes</strong>. Eek… but at least we can all see! Except Kyrin, she is out of range. Oh dear. The Spriggan swipes at Kyrin, poisoning her. She can't regain any HP, and must hurt another creature. She dodges a second sweep of its claws, but the third one hits. Then it casts <strong>Insect Plague</strong> as a bonus action. EMILIO COUNTERSPELLS aaaaa you absolute treasure. As the Spriggan ends its turn, it gets slapped by <strong>Dying of the Light</strong>.</p><p>Shalkoc is angry and must punch something. I yell at him to protect the wizards, but he rushes the Spriggan and whacks it with a <strong>Leaden Fist</strong>, killing it on the spot. Emilio drops concentration. Kyrin is mad that Shalkoc stole her kill. She slashes at him with a <strong>Psychic Blade</strong>, misses on account of being blind, and gets even angrier! I cast a <strong>Healing Word</strong> on her, curing her poison, but she only tries to stab Shalkoc again! He casually dodges and walks away. SHE SHOOTS HIM. SHE SHOOTS HIM WITH THE +2 BOW.</p><p>Fearghas is entirely unbothered and finishes his spell, but does try to teach Emilio about \"measured response\". He does not see the problem in blasting a 7th-level spell on one supposed threat. Plex interrupts the eating of his shoe, pulls a bent fork out of it, and begins casting Planetrotting again. And it's another mishap. We teleport to <strong>Heaven</strong>, fortunately without any devils in sight. We are spotted by Dewey atop the wall, waving at us and telling us to come in. We go in, go through registration, Fearghas has a stern talking-to with Shalkoc, and the angels ask him about the <strong>Commandments</strong>. Shalkoc starts rattling them off, very inefficiently. E for effort, and he still gets level 5 guidance. We kindly request Huey, Dewey, and Louie again.</p><p>We have to go to the market to get Plex some <strong>forks</strong>, as Planetrotting consumes them and he is all out of forks. The whole ordeal takes a good 5 hours, and it is about 21:30 now. We catch up with Shalkoc's dedicated bodyguards. Plex is eyeing a pet turtle like he's going to steal it. In my mind I am already making the hand signs for <strong>Binding</strong> <strong>Shadows</strong>.</p><p>The good angels refuse to rip off Plex by accepting 250 gold for a fork. They do sell forks to Aviana for a reasonable price, who then sells them to Plex for 250 gold apiece. I am screaming IRL. Huey, Dewey, and Louie give us presents! In total 19 <strong>Martyr's Lockets</strong>. They allow the wearer to deliver a willing creature from a curse, by taking the curse upon themselves instead. (conditions apply) I respectfully receive one of the gold pendants and put it on.</p><p>Plex casts <strong>Planetrotting</strong>. Ah shit, here we go again. THANKFULLY, no mishap this time but we do appear 20 miles off, honestly no big deal, it's nothing next to being transported to THE ABYSS. The barren landscape and blazing heat of Avernus greets us, along with raining hellfire and stench of sulfur. In the distance, against the dark sky, rises a thick column of black smoke. We spread out to not all be blasted simultaneously by the fireballs falling from the sky. We do, of course, still get blasted by a few <strong>Fireballs</strong>, except Fearghas who knows how to walk without rhythm, and Kyrin who somehow dodges them all.</p><p>I get 2 DEX saves, pass one, fumble the other. Sigh. Plex sort of goes around the problem by casting <strong>Absorb Elements</strong>. It's a sweaty, gruelling 6-hour walk. We reach the edge of a giant crater, we can't even see the other side, and look down but there is too much smoke and soot to see anything. We do spot some holes inside the crater, all of them spewing thick black smoke. The moment the smoke blows into our faces, we all erupt in fits of coughing and crying. Plex casts a <strong>Gust of Wind</strong>, at Aviana's request, and aims it into the crater. The wind draws in air from the sides, and some of the smoke moves… weirdly. Not like smoke should. More along the lines of <strong>Smoke Mephits</strong>, but they don't seem to have noticed us.</p><p>Fearghas goes to test how unhealthy the smoke is. He passes the save, but that smoke is draining… We'll get exhausted staying in this smoke for long. We start discussing workarounds. Wind Walk… summoning an Air Elemental… Plex' Breezeblossoms… Find the Path? I could Shadowslip down. We settle on <strong>Find the Path</strong>, which points the way straight down. In the meantime I take out my cards and ritually cast <strong>Augury</strong>. I sort of expected that, but I read the result \"weal and woe\".</p><p>Plex is muttering about buying more coconuts, and he fashions a \"<strong>gas mask</strong>\" for himself. Sadly it does not count as a hat. He offers to sell another one. We decide Emilio should get it. Plex asks for his <strong>chicken</strong> back. \"Do you want the one with the bowl or the one with the coconut?\" Emilio picks the bowl, which apparently was very important to a dead man a long time ago, and pays with Plex' last Wooden chicken statue with knife beak.</p><p>Ah, the beauty. Truly a story arc ending. Threads are tied, plot points are resolved. I watch in awe.</p><p>Aviana casts <strong>Resistance</strong> on herself. Multiple times. Risking a surge every time. What could possibly go wrong.</p><p>We descend into the crater, visibility reduced to <strong>60 feet</strong>, the smoke stinging our eyes and irritating our skin. Fearghas' armour starts squeaking as the heavy smoke and ash creep into the joints, he prestidigitates it away when it gets bad. It gets hotter the lower we go; we walk down a winding tunnel and Fearghas trips on something hard. Doesn't look like a stone? It's blackened steel… a merregon's breastplate…? Farther ahead, the horn of a horned devil. Next to it, a satchel. Inside, 8 vials of <strong>Silver Tears</strong>! I really don't want any of that… but I reluctantly take one. Just to protect everyone. I hope with all my heart I won't have to use it.</p><p>About an hour in, with Aviana casting <strong>Resistance</strong> every single minute, she somehow DOES NOT GET A SINGLE SURGE. This right here is the real magic. As we continue walking we realise this place is a maze… but Fearghas' spell guides us. The tunnel opens up, and the ground is pierced by more and more shafts straight down, some wide, other very narrow.</p><p>Fearghas, Shalkoc, and myself get this feeling of <strong>being watched</strong>… and it's coming from everywhere around us except the ground beneath our feet. It even comes from the walls themselves… As we walk on, it only gets more intense. The air is also getting hotter; even for me the temperature is really uncomfortable. We… aren't supposed to be here. Something <em>really</em> doesn't want us here. The environment starts to express this; the ground crumbles right in front of our feet into a deep chasm.</p><p>Fearghas snorts his Silver Tears… but it doesn't help at all. We step into a giant <strong>cavern</strong>. A chasm yawns in front of us, crossed by a stone bridge. Find the Path points straight ahead… We start on the bridge, and a powerful gust of wind roars upward, knocking Emilio, Fearghas, and Plex 30 feet back and prone. The bridge was blasted away, and the <strong>updraft</strong> continues to blow. Aviana is squealing and holding her dress down, although no one is looking.</p><p>Aviana suggests linking us all with a chain, and jumping across. Kyrin suggests as many of us as possible get into her hole. Plex considers <strong>Adjust Density</strong>. When Kyrin brings up the Portable Hole, the two wizards frown. Getting into the hole should be fine, but exiting it probably will see us back in Avernus, as it is an extradimensional space.</p><p>Kyrin casually teleports across with <strong>Psychic Teleportation</strong>; she throws her dagger and first it goes up, then plummets as the air current switches directions and is now rushing <strong>down</strong>. That's… not how air behaves? \"It is if something is breathing in and out,\" Fearghas says. Why… why did you have to say this… the nightmare fuel… Shalkoc flies across. Aviana throws a <strong>chain</strong> across to help the rest of us cross, and holds it steady. Kyrin secures the other end of the chain to rocks. Thankfully, as Shalkoc was about to wrap the chain around a cracked rock!</p><p>Plex halves his density, takes off his shoes to better balance on the chain, and walks across. He makes it but loses his balance at the end, and Shalkoc rescues him in the nick of time. I crawl across but as I reach the exact middle of the chain, out of reach from etiher side, my sweaty hands slip and I lose my grip. I dangle by a leg, the air current pulling me down… Panicked, I meld into darkness with <strong>Shadowslip</strong> and slide across the chain, weightless. On the other side, I remain a tiny pool of darkness, as flat as possible as if hugging the ground. Shadows make no sound but this shadow is whimpering. Kyrin's shadow somehow… stretches and scoots towards mine, as if curious.</p><p>Emilio balances his way across… halfway through, the air current reverses again to <strong>upward</strong>. It throws off his balance and he is launched upwards, narrowly missing rocks that would kill him on impact. Fearghas manages a Feather Fall just in time, but he zooms 200 feet above. Shalkoc flies up after him, and the air pushes him up at superior speed. Emilio slips into <strong>Void Form</strong> and uses <strong>Phase Shift</strong> to teleport to Shalkoc. He grumbles he should have just teleported from the start. Shalkoc exclaims \"Woooo! You can fly as well!\" Thankfully our dragonborn still grabs the warlock and flies them both safely to the ground.</p><p>Right after they land, the air current shifts to downwards again. Fearghas crosses by sheer cool factor, whatever that means. We all retreat from the edge to give Aviana space to land… Fearghas goes first and grumbles… \"We are not alone.\" Emilio looks a little too happy about that. Hey we're not in Muravelara anymore you can chill out. Ahead of us, strands of smoke form into a vaguely humanoid shape, a <strong>Soot Elemental</strong>. It stares at Fearghas, who stares back, and rushes at him. Fearghas raises his hand to fire off a spell.</p><p>Everything around us vibrates and resonates as a <strong>growl</strong> comes from everywhere at once; from down below, bouncing off every stone.</p>"

          "content": "<p><strong>Tuesday, 12</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> of Decimus, 1497</strong></p><p><strong>22:55</strong></p><p>We begin by rolling initiative, and Plex feels an extra angry <strong>stone</strong> appear. Shalkoc sprouts dragon wings and buggers off to the west, flying into a <strong>cloud</strong> that chokes and silences him, uh-oh. Thankfully, he is capable of punching without shit-talking or even breathing! The banter is entirely optional! He hits something in there and <strong>stuns</strong> whatever it is. He then stuns it again, for reasons, and punches ever onwards. The DM ominously appeals to our greed, and Shalkoc backs out of the choking cloud and immediately begins yapping again, it's nice to have him back! I was worried for a second there.</p><p>There is snacking and then Emilio does some <strong>Eldritch</strong> <strong>blasting</strong>. He hits with all three beams but Plex is locked out of the server by Aerelia's ISP. We all get shunted into the aether for few minutes, then Emilio gets a surge and grows to <strong>Large</strong> size! Aviana is delighted and Fearghas freaks out, half the table descends into absolute chaos, excellent.</p><p>Fearghas shoots a <strong>Fire Bolt</strong> and we find out the <strong>Living Soot</strong> is immune to fire, then he stubs his toe on an inconveniently placed tiny rock, which proceeds to get up and hurl itself at the wizard. Oh dear… It misses, and falls prone. I scout out the battlefield in shadow form and take the <strong>Dodge</strong> action. Plex uses <strong>Mold Earth</strong> to fuse the chain with the rock, then hides behind the big rock. Another rock launches itself at Emilio and hits his ankle, dealing minor damage then falling prone.</p><p>Aviana RAAAAAAAAAGES and crosses the chasm, asks Fearghas if the pebble is killing him. He says no, so she concludes the pebble is killing him and uses her <strong>Battering Ram</strong> on it, crashing into Kyrin who was hiding nearby. Woops! She charges again, straight into Plex who was also hiding, and everyone but Aviana could see him. He rolls a dirty 0 on the save and is punted into the pebble behind him. Both are distracted. Emilio talks shit at Fearghas: \"And you complain when I turn off the lights??\"</p><p>The Living Soot floats over to Aviana, does a little spin on itself and creates a poisonous tornado of <strong>Engulfing Sootstorm</strong>. Fearghas, Plex, and Emilio all fall prone and take damage. A rock flings itself at my shadow, but misses and falls prone because I have sick dodges. A light begins to shine out of nowhere! We have the sneaking suspicion a rogue just equipped a sword. Aviana wants to feed a <strong>Potion of Growth</strong> to Emilio. If he activates Void Form does he then turn into a kaiju? Hmmm…</p><p>Kyrin starts slicing at the second Soot that showed up, with limited success. Shalkoc casually punches a puff of smoke to death, and flies over to find a giant Emilio lying on the ground, the rest of us choking, and I'm not even here. Emilio gets up and disregards the need to breathe in favour of slicing at the Living Soot, but he gets ANOTHER surge and <strong>explodes</strong>, catching us all in the blast. It's a massive explosion and we all take heavy force damage! Fearghas is panicking thinking Emilio lost control of his powers and the <strong>Emissary</strong> he ate is corrupting him. I get pushed out of Shadowslip, Kyrin perfectly dodges and takes no damage, and Plex falls unconscious. His <strong>Vortex Warp</strong> contigency activates!</p><p>Fearghas stands up, reluctantly, and eats an opportunity attack by walking away, thankfully it misses. He casts <strong>Magic Missile</strong> at 1st level, hoping it will be the final straw. He gets a surge that protects him from devils, sort of. One Living Soot dies! I slap down a <strong>Wellspring of Life</strong>, then step around the big rock following Fearghas' directions. I spot Plex and yell at him to STOP DYING, casting a <strong>Healing Word</strong>. Then I hide behind the big rock as I don't have enough movement to return to the Wellspring and dip my toes in, sad times.</p><p>Plex agrees to stop dying and <strong>Fey Steps</strong> across the chasm, goes straight back to hugging the Living Soot and choking. Sigh. He bonks a puff of evil smoke with the Spriggan Staff, dealing all of 2 damage. Aviana somehow applies <strong>Death Ward</strong> on Plex. She says to Fearghas, \"Plex is in safe hands!\" and just then, the goblin is grappled and restrained by the remaining Soot, who proceeds to slap him until the ward triggers and leaves him at 1 HP. The Soot then flies away still carrying Plex. Get back here with our goblin! Shalkoc, get him!</p><p>Kyrin attempts to, I quote, \"snatch his little goblin ass back\" but Plex is already too far. She then shoots the Soot, which dies, and Plex is shot 200 feet up by the wind draft. He's still distracted from the soot and unable to take reactions, and so is Fearghas, so what even is Feather Fall? Just then the draft switches back to downwards, sucking Plex in. The winged rescuer Shalkoc flies to Plex using <strong>Step of the Wind</strong> and readies to catch the goblin on his way down. He catches Plex gently like a chicken that escaped the coop. \"I can't let you go,\" he says to Plex, \"you still owe me 7000 gold… with 20% interest.\"</p><p>Hanging over the abyss, Shalkoc and Plex argue over debt and potential <strong>goblinicide</strong>, Plex magicked himself out of Shalkoc's grasp to avoid paying up, but the Dragonborn is a good friend and catches him. We all stack up in the Wellspring and clean off the soot. The spell easily closes all our wounds! As we are healing up and I'm checking Emilio to try to figure out if his void powers are getting out of control, and he is still in <strong>Void Form</strong>… more Living Soots attack us! Yeah that's on us, lingering in a highly hostile area…</p><p>Shalkoc breathes on it, Fearghas chucks a <strong>Ray of Frost</strong> and tells us to get the hell out of here. Ironic, considering… Following his directions, we all start running north, the last location indicated by <strong>Find the Path</strong> before he dropped concentration. Kyrin shoots it, then runs and hides. I try to restrain the Soot with Binding Shadows, but it is immune. Well, worth a try. I run up to Fearghas, but the elemental follows right behind me, putting both wizards and myself in a cloud of poisonous smoke… We all pass the DEX save and take no damage!</p><p>Emilio casts <strong>Steel Wind Strike</strong> and teleports to the Soot to slice it up. Aviana tries to catch it in the Iron Flask but it resists it, good attempt. Shalkoc runs up to the Soot and punches it, gets a surge that <strong>reverses</strong> his damage and healing, misses, punches again, and heals the enemy. We are all waving at him to STOP PUNCHING but we can't speak on account of choking on soot. Shalkoc proceeds to practice social distancing, eats an attack of opportunity for his trouble, and protects himself with his wings.</p><p>Fearghas runs away and stubs his toe, again. He blasts a <strong>Ray of Frost</strong> on the Soot for FIFTY-SIX DAMAGE?! It's vulnerable to cold damage! The smoke from the elemental's body starts freezing, sadly the cloud choking us is not affected. Plex stubs his toe and casts Sapping Sting on the Soot, who saves and takes no damage. Plex teleports… but <strong>Fey Step</strong> takes him to the west and he plummets into the abyss as he is sucked in by the downward draft. Fearghas snaps a <strong>Feather Fall</strong> on him just in time.</p><p>Kyrin swoops from the shadows and slaps a critical hit on the Soot with the <strong>Sun Blade</strong>, smiting the daylight out of it. Plex is still falling to his death, albeit slowly. The down draft increases, as if something massive was taking a really deep breath. I walk up to Fearghas up to the next chasm, but I have no way of getting Plex so I hold myself ready to dodge attacks. Emilio follows suit, also using <strong>Dodge</strong>. Aviana jumps over the chasm and readies the Iron Flask… to catch Plex in it when he inevitably zooms back up.</p><p>Shalkoc slams his fist down, hitting one of the <strong>Slingrock Blocklets</strong>, the pebbles that have been stubbing our collective toes all this while. Instead of getting crushed, it gets shot 20 feet away thanks to its feature <strong>Skipping Tumble</strong>. Just kicking rocks over here. Fearghas <strong>Misty Steps</strong> across the gap and stubs his toe, prompting healthy dwarven grumbling.</p><p>Plex is plummeting towards a pool of lava, though none of us knows this. He uses his <strong>Mage Hand</strong> to loot gemstones, priorities?? Up here, the smoke and fog are getting sucked down into the chasm… Kyrin teleports across. I cast <strong>Levitate</strong> through Lioriel's staff and push myself across. Shalkoc flies down to grab Plex.</p><p>The downward draft becomes so strong, it tears off <strong>boulders</strong> bigger than me from the walls. I hurriedly drop Levitate before getting crushed to death, and follow everyone down with <strong>Feather Fall</strong>. We have no way back up but we have bigger problems right now. And we are right back in initiative order as a thunderous grumbling shakes the walls. Fearghas GLARES at Plex in an attempt at nonverbal communication, but the goblin is confused.</p><p>The ceilings are lower here so Shalkoc needs to land. We sneak through narrow passages, dodging lava pools and giant inhaling currents. Plex uses <strong>Minor Illusion</strong> to make a bunny. Fearghas jumps to grab shiny pyropes. Shalkoc smells money and… steps into the wind currents. He is immediately knocked on his bum. Plex uses Fey Step, teleports himself into the wall and is shunted out. There is a really creepy feeling to this place… like something is following right behind us, getting closer by the second.</p><p>Kyrin tries to grab a toe-stubbing rock, misses, trips and falls prone. Emilio and me fall behind… the soot seeping from the walls seems to solidify, and I make out the outline of <strong>something huge</strong> to the north-west! We need to run for our lives!! Fearghas steps back to catch a glimpse, then runs back saying it's big and we all need to book it. I've been saying the exact same thing! But he doesn't believe me because I'm always squeaking gnegnegne…</p><p>Shalkoc tries to go pick up diamonds glittering in the soot, but steps into the wind again and gets dragged backwards and knocked on his bum. Again. The déjà-vu is overwhelming… Plex places a <strong>Wall of Stone</strong> in the path of the inhale, causing the air current to bounce off and shove Fearghas. Emilio dashes behind me, using his last essence shard on <strong>Netherwalk</strong> to increase his speed.</p><p>The gargantuan creature… GLIDES RIGHT BEHIND US!! It lashes out at me and <strong>grapples</strong> me, picks me up, and flings me at Emilio. I crash into him, knocking us both prone. The monster attacks Kyrin, everyone is shouting, Aviana shoves me into the wind which pushes me next to Fearghas. Kyrin goes invisible with <strong>Psychic Veil</strong>. Fearghas pops a spellgem to inflict <strong>Slow</strong> on the monster, which does not seem bothered in the slightest.</p><p>Plex is grappled, then flung at Fearghas, causing the goblin to lose concentration on the Wall of Stone that was protecting us from the inhale. Shalkoc casts <strong>Guardian of Nature</strong>, then sneezes on the big thing. He proceeds to run off TOWARDS the Giru to pick up loot. He is shouting about money with the monster breathing down his neck… I get to my feet and quicken a 3rd-level <strong>Cure Wounds</strong> on Plex, who immediately creates an <strong>Instant Door</strong> into the wall and steps through it. Emilio is struggling to get through the air current and join us but he is cursed with ever-failing strength saves.</p><p>Shalkoc narrowly deflects an attack with his <strong>Protective Wings</strong>, but the Giru just catches him and flings him instead, over the pile of gold. He smacks against the wall and slides down into the lava. Aviana picks up a boulder and plonks it into the hole from where the wind is blowing, temporarily stopping the current… but the pressure is already building, it won't hold for long!</p><p>Fearghas <strong>Polymorphs</strong> himself into a Stone Whale. <s>execute plan whaleghas</s> He grabs me in his mouth, then similarly eats up Plex who was hiding in a closet of his own making like some green ostrich. He swims through the stone, and gobbles up Shalkoc. Inside Whaleghas, we go on an adventure as he flies all across the cavern to pick up loot. He is picked up and flung into the lava by the Giru… which breaks his concentration on Polymorph!! And uses inspiration to reroll and pass, phew. Shalkoc wants out to loot the place, but we are in lava… Kyrin suggests he goes through the blowhole, \"like a snot rocket\", but even that is too dangerous.</p><p>I sense a request for love and support for Whaleghas, so following Shalkoc's example I cast a warded heightened <strong>Cure Wounds</strong> on him, closing all his wounds. The Giru floats over to us… Whaleghas tries to communicate with Plex, who casts <strong>Tidal Wave</strong>, dousing the lava. Right after, Fearghas uses a Dreamfeather, which causes a surge… TRANSFORMING ALL LIQUIDS WITHIN 5FT INTO LUKEWARM WATER WHEN DRUNK. It only lasts a minute so quick drink up the lava!!</p><p>The Giru whacks Whaleghas until he is no longer a whale and we all land into the lava. Aviana wraps Emilio in chains to drag him through the air currents, and they dash into the cavern. Well Aviana dashes, Emilio just follows somewhat unwillingly. Kyrin is looting the place and picks up, in addition to a lot of gold, a <strong>Sheeshah of Revelations</strong>, a pipe allowing the user to have prophetic visions.</p><p>The smoke lifts, and we see diamonds glittering in the distance! Fearghas chugs a <strong>Potion of Flying</strong> and Polymorphs right back into Whaleghas, and scoops the three of us back up into the whale dimension. He Disengages, gets pushed by an air current on his way, and floats across the cavern towards the exit. I give Shalkoc a good bit of healing, and Plex halves Whaleghas' weight.</p><p>Emilio really wants a snack in the form of essence shards so he starts slicing at the Giru. Good start, but then he rolls a natural 1 and a <strong>Living Soot</strong> pops up. Aviana charges just for the sake of a little HP, dragging our poor warlock along. She then rushes into a narrow passage, still dragging a Large-size Emilio who will not fit in the tunnel… some train memes and mental images later, he gets dragged through, taking only minor damage from the sharp rocks. She shatters the chain, freeing Emilio. <s>She couldn't do this any sooner?</s></p><p>Kyrin happily picks up more diamonds. Emilio then gets flung into the lava.</p><p>\"MacWhale?\" - \"That's Whaleghas MacWhale to ya, son.\"</p><p>A diamond tumbles into Whaleghas' mouth along with some lukewarm water, and I catch it. A big slab of granite comes in…? Along with some half-chewed rocks which whack both Shalkoc and me in the face. Plex somehow triumphantly dodges all the rocks, standing on the stone slab. It's a hover board! I mean, <strong>Earthboard</strong>. Shalkoc is buried under a big slab of rock, in Whaleghas' mouth. He struggles but he is flat as a pancake with all the strength of boiled lettuce. I'm also squished under stone, but I manage to get my hands free and <strong>Levitate</strong> the rocks off of Shalkoc and me.</p><p>Emilio is getting grabbed out of the lava, and flung back into it. Plex wants to… ahem… explore Whaleghas' body?! \"What's the safe word for this campaign?\" Karnack asks. We dissuade Plex, who exits the whale instead. Emilio gets fried by lava, he is alive but barely. He burns his last pact slot on <strong>Void Torrent</strong> to get close to Whaleghas, stubs his toe, and struggles towards me. He pops a shard on Accrued Vitality, not only rolls like shit but also gets a <strong>major surge</strong> which makes a 50% chance to fill unattended containers with spiders. \"Yay snacks!\" Plex exclaims. Screw this I'm casting Remove Curse asap.</p><p>Aviana drops to 0 HP, but she is raging so <strong>Relentless Rage</strong> activates and she drops to 1 HP instead! She uses Battering Ram for temp HP and runs straight south. Coming to a hole in the ground, she sees a city far below… only a city, as far as she can see. It's <strong>Dis</strong>! She tries to shout to us to guide us, but we're too far to hear. Not sure whether to jump, she charges at the wall and leaves a dent. Good job! She drinks up a <strong>Potion of Legendary Resistance</strong> and waits for us to catch up.</p><p>Kyrin teleports closer to Aviana, unfortunately so does the <strong>Giru</strong>. Whaleghas whales to Aviana, and spits Shalkoc and me out. Hey we're right by the exit! He swims through the wall again and grabs Emilio to bring him to us. Whaleghas floats down through the hole, still carrying Emilio. Shalkoc grabs me and unfolds his wings, carrying me down to Whaleghas' back. Plex gets grabbed and flung against Kyrin. The Living Soot grapples and restrains him within the silencing cloud of choking, but Plex burns a Mythic Power on <strong>Convincing Arguments</strong>, persuading himself he is not silenced at all. He casts <strong>Thunder Step</strong> and lands on Whaleghas' back.</p><p>Only Aviana and the Giru are left in Avernus and she is at 1 HP with a little temp HP! She uses a Mythic Power on <strong>Legendary Vigor</strong>, granting her success on Relentless Rage. She shoves the Giru away, and jumps into the hole. Kyrin catches her with telekinesis to avoid the damage from her <strong>Thunderfeet</strong>. The Giru tries to chase, but cannot seem to pass through the hole!</p><p>We all enter <strong>Dis</strong> and feel the realm effect <strong>Dispater's Iron Wards</strong>, making Divination, Illusion, and Enchantment spells really difficult if not straight up impossible.</p>"

          "content": "<p><strong>Tuesday, Decimus 12</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong>, 1497</strong></p><p><strong>23:00</strong></p><p>Whaleghas flies lower, looking for a quiet spot to land but… this place is a giant anthill, without the ants, as far as I can see that is. There are <strong>devils</strong> flying around, yikes. We fly through a sickly yellow, acrid smoke that is still so much more breathable than what passes for air in the <strong>Black Vents</strong>! The urban landscape is dominated by the <strong>Iron Tower</strong> in the distance.</p><p>Emilio comes in clutch as Aviana, Shalkoc, and Plex weren't paying attention. Whaleghas is a whale. Apparently being choked by <strong>Zariel</strong> was educational? He says Dispater is extremely paranoid and the entire city is under constant surveilance. Yeah and a flying whale isn't drawing any attention… Whaleghas is offended by the voice of god calling him fat. Aviana flexes with an inspiring quote to help Whaleghas hide in the smog, and I give him a headpat for <strong>Guidance</strong>.</p><p>We land in an alley just wide enough for Whaleghas to get through; a river of molten slag flows nearby, and the heat near grills us where we stand. Most buildings are metal, and most <strong>glow</strong> as if just taken from the forge… Let's try not to touch anything shall we? Whaleghas spits out Bigmilio who is covered in slobber and grumbles \"Never again!\", to which Whaleghas replies by giving him a big lick and one of the cat ears on his starry hoodie sticks right up. I give Kyrin the very heavy <strong>Earthboard</strong> to put inside her <strong>Portable Hole</strong>. With the sound of a deflating balloon, Whaleghas reverts to Fearghas!</p><p>Of course all this attracted attention and a <strong>Horn Devil</strong> flies down to us asking to see our flying permit, and our landing permit. Kyrin smells an amount of bullshit and asks the devil where his own flying permit is. He is confused and says he doesn't need one on account of being from here. Plex says \"How do you know we're not from here?\" The devil loses brain cells. Kyrin calls him out on trying to shake us down for money. He denies, but just then Fearghas' <strong>Bag of Scolding</strong> begins to abundantly insult him.</p><p>Just our luck, the devil thinks we insulted him. We try to explain, he does not believe us. He tells an outright lie, which deeply disappoints me, where is my White Tower bullshit!! Fearghas tries to be friendly so the devil asks why we're here. Sightseeing and shopping for clothes and spices. He mentions an incident in <strong>Avernus</strong> with a <strong>spice trader</strong>… ahahah… We start talking about <strong>Zacharias</strong>, the viceroy of the viceroy of Dispater! In between Zacharias and Dispater is <strong>Titivilus</strong>, we learn.</p><p>We ask our \"friend\" if he can recommend us a good inn. He points us to a \"cozy\" establishment called <strong>Out of Thyme</strong>. Fearghas gives the devil 3 Soul Coins and he lets us be on our way. We immediately go in the opposite direction. I'm suddenly covered in <strong>spiders</strong>!! Emilio is acting far too innocent about it. We start walking down the bone-paved street as I slap creepy crawlies away and try to not let Plex or Shalkoc catch a snack off my back. Plex is looking at these spiders with far too much interest while Aviana is turning her wings red.</p><p>Plex identifies the spiders, their entire lineage, their history and even the name of their little cousins. And they're edible, he's had similar ones before. I grill Emilio until he admits having a spider-spawning surge, and I flick him on the ankle with a <strong>Remove Curse</strong> at 9th level, then I heal us all with a <strong>Wellspring of Life</strong>. Fearghas casts a Sending to notify our allies in <strong>Mechanus</strong>.</p><p>We spot a <strong>Pit Fiend</strong> intimidating a small person, a Halfling or a Gnome. The small person shakes his head impatiently and ROASTS the Pit Fiend and threatens to turn him into an imp?! <s>All quasits are now French</s>. The Pit Fiend lets out an ear-shattering roar and takes flight, chucking Fireballs into the sky.. Kyrin, Emilio, and Plex didn't slot Earplugs on their armour… The Gnome turns around whistling, but stops the moment he sees Fearghas, who recognises him as <strong>Jubilost Narthropple the jewel-crafter</strong>. Who was killed by Kali over 6 months ago!</p><p>He is… very happy in Hell. Business is booming. What brings you down here, he asks. Sightseeing. Shopping. He invites us to his workshop for a catch-up session. He says the people of Hell recognise and encourage his genius, and provide him with materials. Jubilost takes us to his jewelcutter's workshop; tools are strewn around but everything seems covered in a fine layer of white dust, and in the middle of the room is a third of a 3m in diameter <strong>crystalline sphere</strong> with a ladder to the side, being built from the bottom up.</p><p>Fearghas puts on his <strong>Glasses of True Seeing</strong>. Every 30 feet in the street is a <strong>Scrying</strong> sensor. As we sit down, a crate in the corner bursts into flame. Jubilost sighs, douses the crate, and sits back down. I ask if this is a regular occurrence. The jewel-crafter says \"oh no it's just not very happy here\". He retrieves a <strong>piece of coal</strong> from the crate. Confused, we enquire about it. The gnome lights the coal on fire and drops it into a bowl. A tiny blue flame sparks up; a shard of a spirit, he says. Jubilost asks us to take the spirit with us, and we hurriedly agree. Emilio reaches his hand out towards the flame. Fearghas frowns, but Jubilost seems genuinely sad about the spirit.</p><p>Emilio picks up the coal; <strong>Hearthkeeper's Spark</strong>, basically a pet fire! Shalkoc is excited to have the Spark help him cook. Plex feeds a spider to the Spark, making a stink in the workshop. Shalkoc feeds a piece of chocolate to the Spark. Emilio lights matches and happily feeds them to the Spark. Jubilost is not happy with our bullshit, understandably… He explains he got the Spark when his workshop burnt to the ground.</p><p>Aviana wants to do some post-workout workout and is looking for something to lift. Fearghas finally asks about the crystal elephant in the room, I mean the sphere. Jubilost is making a giant crystal ball out of <strong>angel's tears</strong>… He tried with angel's eyes, but it didn't work as well. I feel sick and look away, but everywhere I lay eyes is more of the white dust, angel's tears… Fearghas cools down Aviana with a <strong>Prestidigitation</strong> on her clothes. Shalkoc basks in the coolness. Jubilost does not want magic in his workshop, for obvious reasons.</p><p>Kyrin is snooping, she is invisible but still leaving footprints in the dust. Just then her invisibility runs out! But Jubilost had his back to her so he doesn't see her pop into existence. Plex offers to trade gems and Jubilost offers old underwear for them. Hole-y underwear, not in the heavenly sense. Jubilost reveals he owns none of his workshop as he is owned by <strong>Titivilus</strong>. We need, of course, permits for everything; owning money, trading money, being in any 30-foot area… Nobody waits for the permits, you're supposed to pay for them.</p><p>Fearghas and Jubilost have a chat, and halfway through the gnome interrupts our friend and asks someone else to talk because he is bored listening to ONLY Fearghas. We ask where we can lay low for a bit; Jubilost talks about a <strong>mansion</strong> not far from here, which has been empty for as long as he's been here. Supposedly there is no surveilance in there, and the owner isn't coming back… The manor's owner is <strong>Zacharias</strong>! Nobody knows what happened to him, and he isn't dead. Fearghas asks if it's legal to go to the mansion. Jubilost says getting caught for trespassing is a crime… aight message received.</p><p>Kyrin asks questions about gems and Jubilost begins info-dumping on her. Aerelia is choking on watermelon, what a surprising change of pace from carrots! We talk about <strong>diamonds</strong> and the cost of spells, and Kyrin is surprised to learn I can bypass material components on spells. Heheh, sorcerers can ignore certain rules. Aviana asks for EYEglasses made of diamonds. Kyrin tells her off for wasting diamonds I could use to <em>bring people back to life</em>!</p><p>Furious shouting and cursing interrupts our friendly conversation, drawing nearer as it announces the arrival of the <strong>Pit Fiend</strong>. Jubilost strongly advises us to \"get the fuck out of here\" as we are not under anyone's protection. We walk down a road lined with caverns and eventually make it to the manor. A bridge that ends in a drawbridge, pulled up, spans a river of lava. Plex pesters Fearghas to write him permits for walking, and for talking, and for his staff, and for his hats… We lose sight of Kyrin, again, and assume she is sneaking too well for any of us to spot her. Again. <s>Aviana don't step on her again</s>.</p><p>In the lava river, two statues crouch on rocks on either side of the bridge. We are super suspicious of the statues. Fearghas casts <strong>Detect Magic</strong> ritually, which is now a 1st-level spell that would consume a 6th-level spell slot, ouch. But ritual casting bypasses spell slots. Plex is now pestering Aviana for permits, who is being surprisingly patient. On either side of the drawbridge, battlements jut out of a stone wall which the manor is built into. Shalkoc picks up two pebbles and throws them at the statues, but nothing happens.</p><p>The bridge is really low over the lava, so since Kyrin can't find any traps we cross rather quickly before the heat can fry us. Kyrin teleports to the battlements, and Shalkoc flies after her. She finds the <strong>mechanism</strong> to let down the drawbridge, and in we go! We close the drawbridge again behind us. <s>Shalkoc somehow breaks the battlemap, confusing the hell out of the DM</s>. Fearghas cautions against scattering… so naturally Shalkoc gives everyone chocolate. Plex pulls out the <strong>Instant Door</strong> but it's not working on these walls! Plex finds out the hard way the walls are magical. Emilio tries to pick the lock by the mundane use of <strong>Thieves' Tools</strong>, but nope. His lockpick gets jammed in the lock…</p><p>There is a fancy, colourful design engraved in the floor… there is dried blood over it, urgh. Plex of course Fey Steps himself into a <strong>cell</strong> on the other side of the door Emilio tried to pick. PLEX GETS INSPIRATION FOR THIS. A squeaky voice speaks to him in a language he doesn't understand. Fearghas wants the door ripped off because the goblin ran off again. Plex successfully makes an <strong>Instant Door</strong> and sneaks around very poorly. \"Hello there,\" says Plex to a tiny green thing staring at him. The green thing tries to hide but its horns and ears stick out of the hay. It's a <s>croissant</s> <strong>quasit</strong>! That's… a demon. What is it doing in Hell?!</p><p>Aviana shoulders the door into next week, then goes back to writing permits for Plex. There is a small office beyond, and another locked door between Plex and us. We kindly ask Kyrin to pick the lock and it clicks open with ease. Fearghas tells off Plex and… sees the tiny demon thing, to which Plex is offering some briar as a snack. The quasit tries to bite off Plex' hand, but he withdraws it real quick. Fearghas casts <strong>Comprehend Languages</strong> to communicate with the demon… Turns out the quasit is insulting the ever-living daylights out of Fearghas and also asking how to get out of here, as an afterthought. Plex also casts Comprehend Languages, both wizards have to cast it ritually as it is Divination and the realm effect makes it troublesome.</p><p>The quasit is not forthcoming with information nor polite. At all. Then it turns invisible. Fearghas advises to <strong>leave it alone</strong> for now. We search the office and find reports from 6 months ago, most of them about punishing servants. The <strong>last page</strong> is ripped out. We find a permit that allows the bearer to carry a permit to imprison people. We're in German gun laws bureaucracy, then… We discuss Zacharias and Fearghas and Aviana describe a dashing Tiefling in a suit, wearing a top hat and doing card tricks. Plex chimes in he was dealing with demons.</p><p>On the other side of the hall, we find a forge full of weapons. Shalkoc sneakily bites his finger to drip blood onto the intricate design in the floor in the entrance hall. The engraving soaks up the blood with supernatural speed… but nothing else happens. The ledgers in the forge have 7 or 8 pages ripped out. In the coals of the forge, now cold, a page has not quite burnt up… Fearghas can just make out the name <strong>U'usholgas</strong>. He finds some <strong>cold iron</strong>, a metal used to fight demons.</p><p>I'm trying very hard to dissuade Plex from teleporting on the other side of the door. Fearghas and Kyrin go question the invisible quasit about U'usholgas, with very little results. Plex starts painting the <strong>Knock</strong> spell on the door. Fearghas pokes Plex with the cold iron, who is very uncomfortable as <strong>fey</strong> creatures also react to that metal. \"We have a demon in the prison! That was unnecessary\", Plex grumbles.</p><p>We gather around the <strong>symbol</strong> carved into the floor and talk about blood. Aviana suggests bleeding Shalkoc above the sigil in the flor and it makes me very sad. Fearghas casts Detect Magic and sees several types of magic. The door is a big slab of carved stone with no handle or hinges, clearly magical. Kyrin sneaks back into the prison to try to catch the quasit so we place our bets. The little demon turns into a bat and camps by the ceiling. Oh it is on. Kyrin uses her shadow to extend her reach and swat him down with <strong>Shadow Strike</strong>. She catches him like a terrible little pidgeon!</p><p>The quasit makes a scary grimace at Kyrin but she gives him a little squeeze right around the throat. He tries to bite, a lot, but Kyrin carries him back to the rest of us. Fearghas grumbles and pays his wager to Aviana. The wizards understand what the quasit is screeching, and it is insulting us of course <s>gorilla warfare</s>. Fearghas translates, it's not gonna work, there is so much blood out there. We still, in Fearghas' words, \"squeeze him like a lemon\". No results, none with Fearghas' blood either. Based on the quasit's rambling and our experiments, we theorise we need… <strong>devil blood</strong>.</p><p>Kyrin and me go up the stairs to the battlements. Clearly bodies have been dumped into the lava over the crenellations, and drops of dried blood remain. Aviana bonks her head on the door, with no result. Plex <strong>Fey Steps</strong>, but appears next to Aviana as he can't control the direction he goes. Fearghas grumbles he can't cast <strong>Disintegrate</strong> on a magical object. We suggest Kyrin sneaks off, abducts a random imp, and we can squeeze that over the symbol.</p><p>She finds 3 <strong>imps</strong>, one of them digging a hole and 2 others drinking beer and watching. She creates a diversion with a ball bearing and distracts one of them. She grabs an imp, stabs it nonlethally, and happily brings it back. Fearghas slices into it, and the blood isn't absorbed into the floor, it spreads in the intricate pattern. Hmmmm, we need more… Well, off with its head. Plex loots the tiny little <strong>workman's hat</strong>.</p><p>We enter into a hall dominated by a pillar. There is a swirling sound like a… <strong>portal</strong> opening…? Kyrin casually rolls a 34 on Stealth and possibly dips into the Ethereal plane. Then Fearghas, with a 35 on Arcana, figures out the portal will take exactly 7 minutes to open. Quick, loot every room!! We roll initiative like DEMIGODS, nothing under a 16 and most over 20. We're wasting all our good rolls! Shalkoc tests a bed for comfort. Plex picks up a lot of paper (permits?). Kyrin opens a chest so sneakily that it doesn't remember being opened; it's never been touched like this! She vaccuums up <strong>3000 gold</strong>.</p><p>Fearghas identifies the portal as a one-way portal to the <strong>Abyss</strong>, and doesn't think anything can come through. We're not under time pressure, so we start investigating the entire area. To the right of the portal room, we find a comfy study or office, one wall of which holds a door obviously opened with a key in the shape of a stylised wing. In the inkwell is a quill made of a <strong>harpy's feather</strong>. The inkwell contains a lot of <strong>Abyssal Nail Polish</strong>! There is another locked door. We guess it leads to a treasure vault, so Fearghas teleports to the other side with a <strong>Dimension Door</strong>. Just as he starts looting, he gets a Sending back from <strong>Mechanus</strong>, we must go back as soon as possible!</p><p>Fearghas herds us like kittens and casts <strong>Plane Shift</strong>, but Aviana does need to go grab Plex by the neck before he can cast Gravity Sinkhole and gets us into massive trouble. We hurry through the formalities of entering Axis, and make it to the room where <strong>Zariel</strong> has been summoned. She is glowering at us. Dis was hot, but the archduchess of Avernus is making the Plane of Fire seem cool now. The Modrons ask Kyrin to hand over the <strong>Beacon of Doom</strong>. Master Kazzim is also here and he is very sad to see the Beacon go. We all sign the contract devised by the denizens of Mechanus.</p><p>\"Pleasure doing business with ya,\" Fearghas says to Zariel. With this we are <strong>free</strong> from our contracts and we can <strong>buy passage</strong> into Dis from the Bronze Citadel! (for the low price of 5000 gold per person) Kyrin says to Zariel, \"Shaik sends her regards.\" Zariel is fuming so much, the nearby Modrons are starting to melt. She turns on her heels, and <strong>Plane Shifts</strong> away.</p><p>Plex exchanges trinkets with Master Kazzim; his <strong>Fabulous Appearance</strong> trap, which goes off, for a model <strong>flying balloon</strong>.</p><p>Aviana pulls out the <strong>Transdimensional Anchorchain</strong> to take us back to Promise. Plex hangs from the chain as he is helping with <strong>Adjust Density</strong>. Fearghas' Guidance makes her pass the strength check on the second try; the Material Plane is pulled towards Mechanus and we all jump through. Aviana is last, and she gets LAUNCHED through the portal at mach 7, misses the cabin, gets catapulted up the slope of her roost and soars back to the town, leaving a crater when she falls. \"Just gotta work on my landing!\"</p><p>We check on the people of Promise, and find <strong>General Ragvond</strong> of the Frost Giants still here. They set up tents in the market square, and their armour is damaged. Ragvond greets us, seeming tired. He says the town was attacked by… undead dragons?! He is very proud of defending the town and most importantly the brewery.</p><p>The island is still travelling towards <strong>Taldor</strong>, where I plan to hire people to investigate <strong>Ildilas</strong>. We learn the children of Promise apparently like <strong>Kali</strong> and <strong>Joline</strong> a lot, and the parents are complaining the two women have been teaching their kids… how to set trap, how to become poisoners, and also archery so some of the kids have returned with arrow wounds. Oops. Kyrin hugs Kali, and the Spidrow freezes, she is not a very affectionate person.</p><p>Fearghas asks about the undead dragons, and if Kali has any more information about them. She brings up the undead army in <strong>Lessia</strong>. Kali warned the Frost Giants so they were ready to face the attack. We tell her about the <strong>vending machines</strong> from Mechanus and she is confused, don't blame her. We discuss the whole \"teaching archery to children by letting them shoot one another\". It's really not as bad as it sounds. We discuss, at length, the children of Promise and their education. The <strong>Springseed</strong> trees are growing nicely, though one of the saplings has a tendency to run off, ah well, even trees can be troublesome.</p><p>We retire to the cabin and look through our loot. Fearghas pays Plex 100gp just so he shows off the papers and scrolls he grabbed from Zacharias' manor. Kyrin distributes the <strong>gold</strong> she looted. Aviana triggers one of Plex' traps, which causes a <strong>surge</strong> turning her skin grey, and another surge poisoning her. Meanwhile Plex gets a surge that cannot be removed and… he gains proficiency with <strong>painter's tools</strong>. All his practice on hags paid off.</p><p>Aviana shrieks PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEX!! and the goblin casually replies \"I did nothing, you knew I trapped the house!\" and Emilio shrugs and says \"I did not eat the Emissary, it just fell through my portal\". Right. Then Aviana opens another door, triggering another of Plex' traps… this one had <strong>Troll musk concentrate</strong>. Now we need to clean the house, Shalkoc says. And another hurting stone shouts OW.</p>"

Fearghas negociates with Plex for spell scrolls. Shalkoc sells chocolate to Plex. The island is still floating towards <strong>Taldor</strong> but it will take 2.5 months before it arrives.</p><p><strong>Fearghas</strong> is researching <strong>stone whales</strong> and looking for dirt on Zacharias but mostly on his boss Toblerone (<strong>Titivilus</strong>).</p><p><strong>Aviana</strong> is trying to craft shoes and hats, and taking a walk in Jotunheim. She's also helping Kyrin make protective gear for the children who are training in archery.</p><p><strong>Shalkoc</strong> wants to acquire (read: enslave and juice) more air elementals.</p><p><strong>Kyrin</strong> is playing with the children as Miri, and learning from <strong>Joline and Kali</strong>.</p><p>I meet up with Fearghas' mum and we exchange plant secrets. Then I join Kyrin and Shalkoc for <strong>spider-speak class</strong> with Kali.</p><p><strong>Plex</strong> is zipping to the <strong>Feywild</strong> to look for help building the Nexus… and introducing fey creatures and plants to Promise, what could go wrong.</p><p><strong>Emilio</strong> is scouting around his home village and he wants to research void portals but… how? Claude got fried researching the Void… Fearghas offers assistance with his <strong>Void Explorer Spellbook</strong>. He also sits cross-legged a bunch doing who knows what.</p><p>Kali tells Shalkoc to please feed <strong>Ivernia</strong>, she is making everyone nervous. The little wyvern wants food, a lot of it, and now please. She'll eat a cow every day. Shalkoc feeds her a few pieces of chocolate. She tries to get into the Snack Pack, misses, and makes puppy eyes at Shalkoc for more chocolate.</p><p>Shalkoc suggests to Aviana building a farm just to feed Ivernia and Kaar so they don't start attacking people. Aviana says, let's please everyone, start a <strong>goat farm</strong> so Plex is happy, kill the goats so Fearghas is happy, and feed the goats to our pets. Back to the spider-speaking class, Kali asks us to share experiences of understanding animals. Shalkoc talks about eating animals, and Kali suggests he maybe tries <strong>feeding</strong> animals instead. Kyrin talks about feeding rats in the city, who'd then bring shiny trinkets. Kali says rats are very tasty. I talk about the small sand cats in <strong>Ildilas</strong> getting into food stores.</p><p>I grumble about the wasps on Ildilas attacking spiders, and Kali encourages me to go talk to the <strong>hornets</strong>. WHY. One of them lands on my staff and walks to my hand. I try to not piss it off. It works out somewhat, then the insect gets into my <strong>cookie jar</strong>. We are finding common ground at last! I put down my cookie jar as a peace offering for the hornets, and over FOUR HUNDRED come to accept the peace offering. That's WAY more than I expected, I lose my cool and leg it as fast as I can, which is not very fast. Kali says when I'm frightened, hornets see me as the cookie as fear smells delicious to them. I am to offer them cookies on the regular and become less scared. Well it gives me a good excuse to pick up on the baking sessions with Shalkoc.</p><p>Kyrin says she mostly has experience with small animals, but she doesn't like <strong>snakes</strong>. Kali agrees they're very sneaky… but they make reeeeeaaaaaally good poison. She tasks Kyrin with helping her milk the snakes for venom. She's not super enthusiastic but I encourage her. Shalkoc wants to eat the animals. Did he show up to the wrong class?? \"We said veterinary, he heard culinary.\" - Kyrin</p><p>Kali advises Kyrin to just not let the snakes bite her. Yay. She then asks Shalkoc about what animals would want to eat HIM. He talks about <strong>dragons</strong> and points at Ivernia, which causes both the spidrow and the wyvern to stare at him. Dragons… aren't animals. They're dragons. Shalkoc does not seem to grasp that, so Kali calls in Aviana's winter wolf <strong>Kaar</strong>. Shalkoc asks if we are cooking him. Kali says Aviana would really not be happy about this, so Shalkoc says maybe he should consider Kaar as part of his group. Kali asks if this is how he sees the world; \"my group, I don't eat, not my group, I eat.\" She is trying to make him think about animals as anything other than food. Kaar is trying to act all cool and edgy but his tail is wagging, what a good boy. A magical ice wolf the size of a bear, but a good boy nonetheless.</p><p>Kali is desperately trying to encourage Shalkoc to be <strong>kind</strong> to animals. She sends him to clean the stables for the next two months, without showing his intention to kill and eat them. Plex gets chased by a swarm of hornets for eating the cookies, and the hornets. Shalkoc asks if the hornets are tasty. Plex teleports away and Kaar runs off as he spots Kyrin returning with a massive <strong>snake</strong> trailing behind her. Kali instructs Kyrin in the milking of snakes. Kyrin is very intimidated by the snake, with fangs the length of her shortsword, and asks very politely for <strong>venom</strong>. The snake does not seem interested in donating venom, but rather in having Kyrin for a snack. Kali is looking at her with this sink-or-swim expression in all six of her eyes.</p><p>In this metaphor Kyrin swims like a fish; she swings around and behind the snake before it can bite her, making it dizzy and successfully collecting the <strong>venom</strong>. For her efforts she gets to keep 1 jar of snake juice. After our lessons, Kali excuses herself as it's time for <strong>dinner</strong> and she would love to inject her own venom into a slab of raw meat to liquefy it, so much more convenient than cooking it and eating with a fork and knife. We walk back to the occasional screams of <strong>Plex</strong> taking turns between eating cookies and running from hornets, and eating hornets and running from cookies.</p><p>Plex does some thinking and comes to the conclusion that running for cookies is a lot of work and he'd rather have other goblins do it. Naturally he decides to recruit people to build the <strong>Nexus</strong> to forbid planar travel to and from Promise, which would cancel out the goblins' curse. Plex invites Kyrin and Aviana to go \"pick flowers in the Feywild\". I go over to Fearghas' mum who is a botanist, and we make plans to build a garden to contain the <strong>fey species</strong>.</p><p>It's Kyrin's first visit to the Feywild, she is amazed to see how vibrant the colours are! The three of them land in a hoofprint left by the <strong>mountain goat</strong>. Aviana is carrying a haybale, on top of which Plex and Kyrin sit. Thankfully (and to Plex' slight disappointment), the titanous goat is nowhere to be seen. They encounter <strong>psychedelic sludge</strong> and Aviana breathes in the pheromones and starts dancing and juggling the haybale. Plex and Kyrin fall off. Kyrin is tripping balls hallucinating burgers. Plex goes to chase a rainbow, which turns into a rainbow-snake. He falls off the rainbow and cannot locate the sky anymore, that's because he is hanging upside-down.</p><p>They thought it was a swamp. It's a sludge of slugs. Plex pierces it with flying <strong>hedgehogs</strong> he wanted to make into sandals. The slug reacts like a scared cat, arching its body, and Plex, Aviana, and Kyrin go sliding down the slug. Hedgehogs rain down! Plex and Aviana are catching so many of them but Kyrin is not putting in any effort. Aviana somehow stays aloft with her wings covered in hedgehogs. Plex is flying! Nope, he slams into the ground and sinks in. The ground moves up and Plex gets launched into the air, having landed in a herd of <strong>bouncing sponges</strong> that were doing their yearly migration.</p><p>As they bounce up and down, they spot wide swathes of unsettling grey in the distance… but that's okay they're bouncing in the other direction. Plex plants his pitchfork into a sponge and invents the pogo stick. They eventually roll off the herd of sponges and spot beautiful butterflies coming over. They're <strong>flesh-eating butterflies</strong> coming for a dead sponge. One butterfly swallows the sponge whole, giving it the look of a pumpkin with two tiny wings, very pleased with itself. Plex collects some butterflies.</p><p>They find a river with banks covered in soapy moss, and wash up. Then they are chased by a tree-sized mushroom, and finally stop tripping. <strong>Cicadas</strong> scream at them, so Plex catches some with the intention of eating them. <strong>Tiger poppies</strong> are drugs if you smoke them, Plex explains, just watch out for their fangs. Plex hands Kyrin <strong>Jim's Lance of Compensation</strong> to harvest the flowers from a safe distance. The tiger poppy just laughs as it's really ticklish, and curls up into a ball. Good time to pick it up!</p><p>A mountain approaches… Plex leaves the hay as a tribute, but not before signing it by painting his face on it. Plex coaxes a sponge to follow him by bouncing on his \"togo-stick\". He casts <strong>Adjust Density</strong> to make Aviana heavy so she can use the <strong>Transdimensional Anchorchain</strong> and bring them all back to Promise. The portal only stays open that long, so out of the group of sponges Plex wanted to bring back, only <strong>nine</strong> make it through in time. Aviana reopens the portal, allowing two more sponges through but she wants MORE and holds the portal open, allowing yet two more to pass. The sponges get LAUNCHED through, soaring all the way to the cabin where Fearghas is casually reading.</p><p>Aviana slashes one sponge into ribbons, still holding the chain with one hand. The portal snaps shut again but Aviana is angry and yanks it open with the force of a <strong>natural 20</strong>. Three sponges come through, followed by Kyrin and Plex. Aviana lets the portal close, getting <strong>slingshot</strong> through. Kyrin lugs a <strong>Spidersilk Bomb</strong> hoping to catch some sponges. Plex is on his pogo-stick and Aviana is hurtling through the Springseed forest (the trees have wisely learnt to leave a path). The harpy grabs Plex by the neck yelling at him to \"cast slow fall\". Plex holds on to the pogo-stick for dear life and pulls his hats over his eyes, incapable of casting while he is grappled.</p><p>Plex yells at Aviana to let him go so he can cast spells. He decides the best course of action is to cast… <strong>Reverse Gravity</strong>. With the town just below. People, pigs, Frost Giants, objects are lifted into the air. Kyrin dodges mid-air, while trying to herd the sponges in her silk bombs. General Ragvond is having a blast, waving at Aviana as she tumbles through the air. Plex burns all his spell slots on <strong>Feather Fall</strong>, Aviana switches to <strong>Eagle Spirit</strong>, and Kyrin throws her last <strong>Spidersilk Bomb</strong> to save as many people as they can when Reverse Gravity drops. Plex gets a surge and… for the next month, the next <strong>dog</strong> he sees is God. He spot Miss Rose's chihuahua flying 100 feet in the air. Plex lets some people fall to their death to cast <strong>Vortex Warp</strong> and catch the dog, forcing Aviana to pop a spellgem instead.</p><p>Fearghas feels a disturbance in the Force and gets up from reading his book, walks to the window and glimpses the chaos.</p><p>Half the town has severe trauma, the <strong>Frost Giants</strong> want to go again. Kyrin is lugging a big net of 18 pumpkin-sized bouncing sponges, stopping every few steps so they don't start bouncing too much. Aviana spots Fearghas and Plex tries to sneak away. I come back from the Springseed forest at this point and meet with Shalkoc who just got done mucking stables. And here is Emilio emerging from a dark corner where he was meditating, drawn by the chaos. Plex tries to pogo away which is not sneaky at all and Fearghas snaps at him to GET BACK HERE. Plex pretends he did not hear and bounces away. Fearghas yanks him back with <strong>Telekinesis</strong>. Plex plays dumb. Fearghas DEMANDS to know what is going on.</p><p>\"It all started when we started doing drugs.\" - Aviana</p><p>Kyrin attempts to explain. Plex releases a flying hedgehog, not helping his case. Fearghas is struggling to process it. At my prompting, Plex explains the sponges reproduce asexually; when they grow too big, they split into two. They're edible, as they harden when they die. Actually very tasty, which makes them decent livestock animals. At Plex' urging, we try to use the sponge herd to move the <strong>obelisk</strong> at <strong>Locus</strong>. To Fearghas' great shock, Plex' theory works perfectly and we smoothly get the monolith in the middle of town. Kyrin helps position it properly with her telekinesis. Now we just need to build around it to set up the <strong>Nexus of Binding</strong>!</p><p>Fearghas learns stone whales are found in the <strong>Mountains of Madness</strong>, south of the <strong>Redwind Sands</strong>. Research into <s>Toblerone</s> Titivilus is relatively easy; he is practically running Dis, as Dispater himself is not very present. Oddly, he seems loyal to Dispater. Zacharias rose through the ranks very quickly, and became viceroy to Titivilus only about 80 years ago, very recent in devil years. Fearghas supposes Zacharias has a connection to the demon lord <strong>Pazuzu</strong> (harpy feathers, vrocks on the other side of the portal in his manor). Pazuzu would definitely take a stance towards the recently returned dragons, as he aims to claim dominion over all winged creatures.</p><p>Plex rolls a 24 with painting supplies. PLEXWHATAREYOUPAINTING. \"Nothing,\" he says. This will come up again.</p><p>Emilio is looking to return to his village in the <strong>Solemn Watch</strong> mountains… that's really far away! (several thousand kilometres in non-retard). Fearghas <strong>Teleports</strong> him there and the second they come close, Emilio's patron gets agitated. The closer they get, the more Emilio's patron shifts from hunger to survival mode. He's never felt this before. Whatever is there, it makes his patron feel like <strong>prey</strong>. Emilio advises STEALTH and not staying long; there isn't just one entity here, more a creeping feeling of wrongness and misplacement.</p><p>Emilio opens up to Fearghas about the <strong>void portal</strong> in his village, and how his father threw him in as a sacrifice. Fearghas tries to comfort him, then he casts <strong>Wind Walk</strong> so they may scout undetected. It's evening and the sun is sliding west, but instead of red sunset light, the air has a <strong>purple</strong> tint. The mountains look wrong too… some are too jagged, others look like they've been stomped down. There is no wind, no clouds, they can't feel warmth nor chill. The ground is cracked, fog is clinging to the forest down below. The trees look sick or dead… or not like trees anymore, overgrown with mould like cancerous tumours.</p><p>They approach the last hillside barring the view to Emilio's village… and something sees them. A <strong>large fleshy eye</strong> opens in the moutainside. Emilio barely keeps his wits about him as his patron quivers, feeling cornered. Fearghas is overcome with madness, trying to attack his friend (thankfully it doesn't work great in cloud form). Emilio picks up on this and flies away, getting Fearghas to chase him. They streak through the sky until Fearghas manages to snap out of it and <strong>Teleports</strong> them both back to Promise. They give us the very worrying news that an entire area of the world is being corrupted by the Void.</p><p>When they get back, Fearghas is teleported against his will to the mines of <strong>Lessia</strong>, mid-sentence as he was talking to Emilio. It's the same surge that teleported him to the <strong>Plane of Water</strong> a month ago… He casts <strong>Invisibility</strong> and tries to sneak with all the stealth of an elephant dancing in chain mail and is heard by three people; two of the <strong>king's honour guard</strong> and a <strong>Duergar</strong>, in full armour and interrupted in the middle of a civil conversation about poison and casualties on their way to Lessia. They start towards him and he dips through a side corridor but his stealth is atrocious and they follow the noise he makes.</p><p>Fearghas casts <strong>Polymorph</strong> and transforms into a rat to escape his pursuers. He is now Ratghas. Once the other dwarves turn back, he /unrat and <strong>Teleports</strong> back to Promise, getting back eventually to a very confused Emilio. <strong>Wind Walk</strong> is still active so Fearghas turns into a thundercloud and flies over Emilio's head, grumbling Dwarven curses all the while.</p><p>We return to the cabin and find Plex in a room with Rose's chihuahua, covered in blood with 2 clothed chickens sacrificed to the dog, who looks far too pleased with the situation. I firmly decide to not deal with this for a second and take off my spellwards, slap one hand on the dog for effect and the other hand on Plex. I channel a 9th-level <strong>Remove Curse</strong>, Plex tries to <strong>Temporal Shunt</strong> me, Fearghas <strong>Counterspells</strong>, Plex wants to keep the dog. I argue we should get the little thing back to its owner, so Aviana casts Speak with Animals and asks the dog who it wants to live with. She translates \"scratch me behind the ears now\".</p><p>Plex relents that Rose may have the dog back, but she owes him two chickens. The chihuahua demands human blood, despair, suffering, and ear scratches. Fearghas scoops up the abyssal little shit, hands it to Kyrin, and we both go to the town to return the dog to Rose.</p><p>As we get to the settlement we hear a booming voice demanding the return of his gold. <strong>General</strong> <strong>Ragvond</strong> is squeezing the life (?) out of the vending machine we rented from <strong>Axis</strong>. We try to de-tangle the situation. Ragvond wants his money back, an apology, and a duel as reparation. Turns out Ragvond was trying to buy… gear. Like armour and weapons. And he bought… gears. Machine parts. Fearghas tries to explain, but Aviana speaks… closer to his language.</p><p>It does not go well. Ragvond compliments Fearghas on his width and then tells him to use simpler words. \"That's why I said we should stick to raiding. Trading was a mistake.\" Ragvond mutters. Fearghas puts a lot of effort into explaining to Ragvond how to properly use the <strong>vending machine</strong>. The Frost Giant is not receptive. No one else in Promise has had problems with the vending machine, Ragvond is just an idiot. A very big, very angry idiot. Aviana offers to give him his money back. He slaps her on the back so hard, she sinks into the ground. The harpy manages to appease the general by paying him half his money back and apologising, and promising a chance to <strong>reclaim his honour</strong>. We'd help but we have to be uuuuuh where are we going again? Mining scenarium and plotonium, yes. She asks Plex to paint the offending vending machine <strong>red</strong> to signify his evil deeds, and replace it.</p><p>Emilio tells us about the <strong>Void</strong> shullbit. I squeak. Fearghas describes the eye in the mountain, and admits it messed with his mind. We discuss the reaction of Emilio's patron. Aviana suggests going to the <strong>Abyss</strong>. I threaten to vomit on her. Fearghas joins in saying we could find good intel in the Abyss. And here is my migraine again, I had not missed it. Fearghas insists we should at least speak with <strong>Yuguloths</strong> in Hades.</p><p>We try to think of how to contain the Void corruption. Fearghas shows us his <strong>spellbook</strong> again, and says its author ventured into the Void as protected as they could be, and upon returning penned the book… but as the writing progresses, it makes less and less sense, with the last pages completely incomprehensible. With the most powerful protective magic in the world, the Void's <strong>madness</strong> still caught up to the author… We are absolutely certain the Void will make us mad. Fearghas has copied a <strong>spell</strong> capable of opening a void portal, but he does not yet understand it enough to cast it. Which is for the best, because he does not know how to close the portal…</p><p>We decide to first go back to <strong>Dis</strong> to hopefully fulfil Fearghas' contract of killing <strong>Zacharias</strong>, and also to look into saving the <strong>Feywild</strong> from the abyssal corruption, hopefully that will give us ideas to deal with Void corruption.</p><p>As time passes and we mostly stay on Promise, taking care of the settlement and its people, we decide to build the <strong>Nexus of Binding</strong>, the <strong>Goblin Quarters</strong>, and the <strong>Market Square</strong>. This will really tank our economy though so we better be ready for this.</p>"

          "content": "<p><strong>Friday, 13</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> of Undecimus, 1497</strong></p><p><strong>15:00</strong></p><p>The goblins are tanking the economy.</p><p>Kyrin is sick of milking snakes (don't blame her). I am now deliberately baking cookies for the hornets. Better not ask Shalkoc what he's been doing the past few weeks… Fearghas gets a surge that protects him from slaps for an hour, to an extent. Aviana <strong>flexes</strong> to inspire him, and he restyles her <strong>Headband of Intellect</strong> into sunglasses, using some alchemy bullshit to make the lenses darken in the sun.</p><p>We'd decided to head to Muspelheim to take care of Loki's quest, retrieving <strong>Rovagug's Chain</strong> from the fortress <strong>Obsidian's Cradle</strong> in the volcano <strong>Surtr's Jaws</strong>. We are absolutely not doing this quest so General Ragvond stops draining the beer supply and goes home. Nobody has seen Plex for a few days so we are all concerned and somewhat on edge. So instead of just sitting around waiting for something to explode, we decide to use the <strong>Nexus</strong> to travel to the Frost Giants' camp a couple miles from Obsidian's Cradle.</p><p>Fearghas wants to juice Aviana for monster blood to brew <strong>Fire Resistance</strong> potions. She runs away. He chases her saying IT'S FOR SCIENCE. Fearghas goes to the vending machine, but no luck. Modrons have very little use for potions after all. We are currently flying over the <strong>Green Sea</strong>, a vast grassland where <strong>Griffons</strong> and <strong>Ankhegs</strong> are known to roam the land as pests. We decide to hop down (literally, using <strong>Feather Fall</strong>), hunt some giant bugs for blood, anchorchain back to Promise and then go to Muspelheim.</p><p>Fearghas starts tying us all together with rope. \"Oh, we're tying up people??\" Aviana happily pulls out a chain. We try to calculate which of us falls the fastest, but Aviana took off the <strong>Sunglasses of Intellect</strong> so she has no idea. Oh well. We jump off and hurtle towards our death, wind roaring in our ears, the ground rushing closer… until Fearghas casts Feather Fall and we gently fall down and land in a beautiful emerald expanse, nothing but grass on the horizon except for one <strong>keep</strong> in the distance, and a small <strong>village</strong> behind us.</p><p>We vote for the village and walk about an hour there. We find… no one there, farming tools abandoned as if people had just dropped them and ran. Emilio is distracted by how peaceful the place is (and maybe still happy about jumping off the island). Kyrin sees a <strong>door</strong> slightly ajar and casually walks over to check it out while Aviana is dejectedly noting the sheer absence of <strong>boulders</strong> or rocks of any sort. The house has a barn attached, and she spots an eye glancing through the spaces between the planks. As soon as she spots the spy, she hears a child scuttle off and hide in the hay. In child form, she walks in and calls out a friendly hello in Common.</p><p>A male voice questions back where we're coming from, what we're doing here, and what is going on. Kyrin replies in a very straightforward manner, just not saying where we're from. We want to hunt <strong>Ankhegs</strong>, she says. The man asks where her parents are. She calls <strong>Fearghas</strong> over for assistance. He asks what is wrong and the man replies terrified, \"the sky is falling down\". Yeah I suppose Shalkoc drove Promise a little too close to the ground…</p><p>We agree to all hide in the barn. All the cows are muzzled… \"Flying things can't smell you when you hide in hay,\" the man says urgently. Aviana takes offense. We all gather in the barn and Fearghas happily introduces us all. The farmers freak the hell out and take out the pitchforks on <strong>Aviana</strong> of all people. She steps outside to appease the people, which causes the people to spot <strong>Shalkoc</strong> and panic all over again.</p><p>Fearghas tries to explain our friends are people and will not harm them. He gives his word, as people trust a <strong>dwarf's word</strong>, that none of us means them any harm. He then says we're monster hunters and looking for Ankhegs to murder. The man runs off to find the Elder, Fearghas asks for his name, he shouts he is called <strong>Louis</strong> and disappears around the next house.</p><p>Louis returns with an old man, <strong>François</strong>, who is very glad to see monster hunters, as they've called for help. He asks if we can do anything about the flying island… Shalkoc asks if he wants it moved to the left, or the right? Fearghas kicks him, and tries to reassure Francois. He is not very trusting, don't blame him, I didn't think Promise was real at first. Shalkoc says they should untie the cows' mouths as this is not very healthy for them. Wow, character development.</p><p>François thinks Shalkoc is a <strong>paladin</strong> and kneels down in reverence, because Kyrin said he's kind of a holy person, as a monk. Louis wants to take care of the paladin's horse. We try to explain our \"lord\" does not have a horse as he can fly. The rest of us walk. The farmers want to see a <strong>pegasus</strong> and Kyrin gives Fearghas a pointed look, hoping he can Polymorph into one. He grumbles and tries to clear up the misunderstanding, which really amuses the children hiding in the barn. The adults a bit less, as they stand up disappointed.</p><p>Fearghas is losing his mind trying to get the farmers to direct us to monsters. Finally with Kyrin's help they point us towards a 50 feet high <strong>plateau</strong> maybe a 2-hour walk away, saying <strong>Griffons</strong> tend to fly from over there. What we know is the people in this land are <strong>serfs</strong> and don't own anything, getting what they need by bartering with one another. Kyrin trades some coins with Emilio, then gathers up the children and does some <strong>sleight of hand</strong> to impress them as she gives them each a copper coin. They don't know what money is, so she tries to explain. The children ask if the coin can \"bring grandma back\". EMOTIONAL DAMAGE.</p><p>The children are very confused and talk about a mean thief called <strong>Antoine</strong>. They don't realise what a thief is, bless their little hearts. Francois and Louis advise Fearghas to go to the manor afterwards and get our reward from the <strong>lord</strong>. The farmers will continue to hide, and Louis insists on giving us hay to mask our scent. We finally walk away, Fearghas and Kyrin grumbling to each other.</p><p>We talk about Griffon <strong>eggs</strong>, the stealing of them to raise them as mounts. They're friends, not food, we tell Shalkoc. By the cliff, we find the fresh-ish remains of a horse and Aviana spots a Griffon circling high up. There are 3 more, and Fearghas casts <strong>Silent Image</strong> to make an illusory horse and get them to swoop down. We murder two, and Fearghas juices them for blood while Kyrin looks for eggs, with Shalkoc's assistance.</p><p>Kyrin and Shalkoc find eggs, they also find Griffons, knock them out, then Shalkoc tries to get one male and one female but has no idea how to tell them apart. Kyrin feels bad about killing them and stealing their eggs, so she telepathically asks Fearghas if he can <strong>shrink</strong> them so she can keep them. The problem is getting the tiny Griffons into the spider silk bag, so Emilio tries to intimidate them. Rolls a 4. The Griffons give them a side eye full of pity. We also chuck the dead Griffons into the <strong>Portable Hole</strong> to later harvest their hides and meat.</p><p>Kyrin and Emilio have an excited discussion about traumatising children. I ask Fearghas for something against migraines. Fearghas asks Aviana to <s>yank her chain</s> have a go at the <strong>anchorchain</strong>, but predictably does not manage to even lift it. I give Aviana emotional support in the form of <strong>Guidance</strong> and she opens the portal on the first try.</p><p>We return to Promise with two live Griffons, shrunk. Two dead Griffons, in the hole. One Griffon egg. With Fearghas' input I identify the live Griffons as a <strong>mating pair</strong>, and these usually only have 1 egg anyway, they eat up all but the biggest egg. We go talk to <strong>Stormwind</strong> the military captain, hand her the Griffons, and Fearghas tells her to figure it out. She is confused and says tentatively she'll see what she can do…? The soldiers don't even have horses, none of them is trained with animals.</p><p>Fearghas has a stroke of genius and remembers Aviana's tribe of <strong>Goliaths</strong> lives here. They can handle the Griffons just fine! That leaves the dead Griffons, which Shalkoc is absolutely DYING to cook. Fearghas gets to brewing, with the inspiration of Aviana's fantastic flexing. He whips up a large batch of <strong>Potions of Fire Resistance</strong>, and then some <strong>Potions of Psychic Resistance</strong>, for reasons (looks at Emilio).</p><p>Kyrin does drugs using the <strong>Sheeshah of Revelations</strong>, which gives her similar effects to a <strong>Divination</strong> spell. She asks where the chain is being kept inside the fortress. She has a vision of a large, very long <strong>chamber</strong> with rocky walls, deep underground. It's filled with bubbling magma, and in the middle of the chamber a stone path stretches across the magma. At the end of the path is a hole in the ground, and into the hole hangs a <strong>chain</strong>. The only way into the chamber is a spiraling stair leading down into the chamber. We know this of course because Kyrin sketched it.</p><hr><p><strong>Sunday, 15</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> of Undecimus, 1497</strong></p><p><strong>20:30</strong></p><p><strong>Short rest</strong></p><p>We take a few days to properly prepare our excursion to Muspelheim. Fearghas casts <strong>Legend Lore</strong> on the Chain of Rovagug, and learns it is actually the name of a mountain range that goes around the Elemental Planes. These mountains keep the end of the world sealed away by restraining <strong>Rovagug</strong>, a god of destruction. The item we are looking for is in fact stolen links from this mountain chain. Odd… the chain is giant in size, but not mountain-size. We figure out the metal chain was originally laid around the Elemental Planes, and the mountain range grew around the links. Some of these links have been stolen. Not ominous at all, that. The links can enslave <strong>Fire Elementals</strong> by consuming and destroying their essence.</p><p>Fearghas casts another Legend Lore on <strong>Obsidian's Cradle</strong>. It is a fortress of black stone in the middle of a lava lake, that lies between the twin peaks of Surtr's Jaws. The only way in is across a large bridge and through a gate. The fortress used to be a temple to a deity of fire, <strong>Imix</strong>. It is still guarded by the warlocks of Imix. A prophecy says \"Obsidian's Cradle will fail only when Surtr's tears dry up or he chokes on them\".</p><p>At this Aviana suggests to <strong>frighten</strong> Surtr to make him cry, by making use of Emilio. Hm. Fearghas ritually casts <strong>Contact other Plane</strong> while Aviana very incorrectly babbles about ther memories of Muspelheim. He contacts the spirit of a long-dead sage <s>Boogle the Moogle</s> to ask five questions:</p><p>Are Fire Giants weak to cold damage? - <strong>Some</strong>.</p><p>Are they resistant to radiant damage? - <strong>No</strong>.</p><p>Is Rovagug close to breaking free? - <strong>Unclear</strong>.</p><p>Are there any other entrances to Obsidian's Cradle? - <strong>No</strong>.</p><p>Can the Fire Giants be bribed with dwarven ale? - <strong>Unclear</strong>.</p><p>Shalkoc cooks up some food for us all: a big pot of <strong>cool ghoulash</strong> for Emilio, himself, and me. Fearghas gets a <strong>spicy jacket potato</strong> which makes him very happy. Kyrin gets a <strong>bento box</strong> with teriyaki grilled chicken and it looks absolutely delicious! Aviana gets the <strong>Fire Resistance Pie (tm)</strong>.</p><p>We teleport to Muspelheim and oh my god it's hot. At least it doesn't reek of sulphur. Vast expanses of obsidian are criss-crossed by rivers of lava and dotted with molten lakes. On a more stable piece of ground stands an encampment surrounded by a palisade made of long icicles rammed into the ground. Fearghas puts up <strong>Rary's Telepathic Bond</strong>. In the distance, a large volcano with two peaks dominates the landscape. Aviana changes the colour of her wings to a bright red. The ground shifts and cracks constantly; we assume the Frost Giant camp is only on stable rock thanks to the icicles cooling the ground.</p><p>We carefully make our way to the camp, but it still takes a couple hours. There are things swimming in the lava… ah yes lava sharks. The young ones are the size of a bull. Aviana, Fearghas, and Shalkoc remember these lava sharks can jump really far… and they are extremely aggressive. How do we dodge them? Fearghas suggests Wind Walk but we decide to save the spell slot. Aviana stands at the ready with the <strong>Dented Iron Flask</strong>. We try to be stealthy but I squeak, Aviana complains loudly, and Emilio turns around to shout at her \"We're trying to be sneaky will you SHUT UP!\"</p><p>A lava shark jumps out and Aviana throws the <s>Pokéball</s> Iron Flask. She catches the shark and yells back at Emilio. Nobody knows where Kyrin is. She's telepathically yelling at us but we can't see her. Aviana suggests she will release the shark and we all murder it immediately. She looks around for other sharks and with a natural 20 feels them <strong>watching</strong> her from the lava.</p><p>We get concerned Aerelia might be smelling burnt toast but it's just burnt code.</p><p>Shalkoc misses his attack and the shark isn't <strong>stunned</strong>, but we pummel it so hard it dies anyway. Shalkoc starts singing Lava Shark and we all have it stuck in our heads now. He makes theories with Aviana on how to cook the shark, because aren't they already cooked?</p><p>The other lava sharks are now… mad at us. Yeah I wonder why. Some of the stone plates in the distance are bobbing up and down as if <strong>something really big</strong> was hitting it from below, hmmm. We're about 500 feet from the camp. Time to run for it!</p><p>We hatch a plan. Fearghas gives his <strong>Bag of Scolding</strong> to Kyrin, and he jumps into the Portable Hole. Emilio, Aviana, Shalkoc (after giving the <strong>Snack Pack</strong> to Kyrin), and myself follow him in. We have to squeeze a bit so I tell Aviana to sit and I get on her shoulders. Kyrin picks up the hole and makes a run for it with <strong>Psychic Teleportation</strong>. She runs on moving ground, dodging lava and shifting rock. A vent spews gas and she tanks the poison like a champ. A big boulder next to her starts to move! It was never a big boulder, it's a <strong>Cinderslag Elemental</strong> and it's BLAZING hot.</p><p>The elemental takes a swing at her and misses, but the second one hits. She <strong>Uncanny Dodges</strong> to halve the damage, and endures the scorching heat. A lava shark lands next to her! She dodges the impact but gets pushed a step back. It bites; one miss, one hit. The hit is really spicy but her armour is enhanced by the realm effect so it takes a tiny bit off. She's almost there… Another <strong>Psychic Teleportation</strong>, Dash… she narrowly dodges another shifting plate of rock and reaches the Frost Giant camp! The giants are so baffled, they are staring with their mouths open completely floored.</p><p>She lands from her leap in between the two speechless Frost Giants. She unfolds the hole and lets us all out, and returns the bags. I begin to treat her burns and wounds as Fearghas uses an <strong>Ioun Stone</strong> to speak Giant and greet them, saying <strong>General Ragvond</strong> sent us. They ask for proof, so Fearghas pushes Aviana forward, saying she carried the <strong>Nullstone</strong>. \"There is no way she was that small,\" they say to each other. Aviana pulls out the anchorchain, which convinces them. As well it should, it's a unique item…</p><p>They apologise, saying there has been a lot of trickery, and let us into the camp. It's comfortably <strong>cool</strong> here… for the others probably. My teeth are chattering so I snuggle up to Aviana. The guards escort us to the tent of their general. On the way we see <s>bolar pear</s> <strong>polar bear pelts</strong> that Kyrin eyes a little too long for comfort. One of the guards wears a necklace made of Griffon beaks and skulls. He said his father brought it from a raid when he was a child. Kyrin says that's neat, we killed Griffons earlier today. We realise the guard's dad raided… the <strong>Green Sea</strong>. He asks us where it is, he'd like to raid it in his father's memory. Sadly Aviana speaks Giant as well and answers in a very straightforward manner. (Fearghas was trying to not translate Kyrin's answers precisely…)</p><p>Kyrin gives a Griffon <strong>feather</strong> to the guard. He is astounded, he didn't think those things had feathers as his father described the Griffons as tiny dragons. Fearghas uses <strong>Minor Illusion</strong> to show him what a Griffon looks like. He doesn't believe us. Kyrin is disappointed but eh, it was a nice thought. Aviana wants to pour the <strong>Potion of Growth</strong> into her ale so there will be more of it. That's not how potions work. She just wants to share her <strong>Bugman's Ale</strong> with the giants but there is not enough of it.</p>"

          "content": "<p><strong>Sunday, 15</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> of Undecimus, 1497</strong></p><p><strong>21:30</strong></p><p>Plex spent the last few days (and a lot of forks of increasingly dubious origins) finding his people and bringing them to Promise. In doing so he met the brothers <strong>Antx and Prantx</strong> who helped procuring the forks. Because of the <strong>Planetrotting</strong> spell, he ended up visiting… pretty much every plane known to goblinkind. And missing Promise a couple times. Plex is currently in an extradimensional space… which turns out to be Kyrin's <strong>Bag of Holding</strong>. She reaches in to grab a Griffon feather, he bites her finger (normal response for Plex), she yelps and pulls the goblin out of the bag, causing him to grow back to his normal size.</p><p>Fearghas pulls out his <strong>magic tankard</strong> to relieve the headache caused by Plex' appearance. The Frost Giants ask why we keep our pets in our bag. Why do we keep our Plex in our bag? We try to ask Plex how we got into the bag, and whether there are any more goblins in the bag. Shalkoc offers him <strong>food</strong>, as Shalkoc does. Kyrin asks me to check the bite on her finger, in case Plex has rabies and her finger turns black and tries to fall off. She'll be fine, I'm sure. I rolled a 4 so she is definitely totally fine.</p><p>We're just waiting outside the tent of the Frost Giants' leader as Shalkoc pulls out his frying pan, but just then the tent opens and we are invited in. Shalkoc grumbles and puts away his pan, Plex isn't too hungry after chomping down on our rogue's finger. The leader's tent is largely occupied by an immense table covered in a <strong>map</strong>, and a <strong>model of the volcano</strong> (big enough for me to live in). The leader is covered in tattoos, and his beard is very short for a Frost Giant. He introduces himself as <strong>Commander Frengald</strong>.</p><p>Fearghas is the only one paying attention and he spots a <strong>big ornate chest</strong> next to the bedroll, securely locked. Each of these locks is about the size of ME. Frengald asks us in Common whether we are the ones hired by Loki. We say yes, so he places a <strong>shield</strong> on the ground and bids us all get on it. Plex helps by making Fearghas lighter, indirect fat-shaming of our dwarf again, how sad. We all get on the shield, which Frengald lifts onto the <strong>table</strong> 10 feet up so we can get on it. Giants, man… would have been an entire adventure for me to get up on that table.</p><p>Frengald asks us to bring <strong>Rovagug's chain</strong> to him. Hmmm. Ragvond on Promise just asked us to retrieve it. Kyrin, looking like a somewhat charred little child, says she ran through the lava fields. Frengald is bamboozled, reaches up to stroke his beard, finds there is not enough beard for this, is sad. He says the Frost Giant campaign here has been going on for <strong>two years</strong> with no progress. We are confused by timey-wimey stuff, but <strong>Jotunheim</strong> and <strong>Muspelheim</strong> being both located in <strong>Limbo</strong>, it's not too surprising time sometimes flows differently from back home.</p><p>We confirm the only entrance to the fortress is through the bridge, and the main gate. The fortress is surrounded by lava except for the road leading to the main gate. Kyrin asks if the fortress every gets deliveries through the gate, but they get <strong>Elementals</strong> to do their deliveries through the lava… We peer at the model and start thinking. The Frost Giants sent hawks, but they all died so the air defence is up there. There are <strong>arcane golems</strong>, without a body, inside the fortress. Outside, flying elementals called <strong>Exuls</strong> take down anything that so much as gets off the ground for more than a jump.</p><p>Aviana wants to dig a hole deep in the ground to drain the lake of lava. I don't think Fearghas has enough ale to explain to her why this cannot work. Frengald suggests the Frost Giants create a <strong>diversion</strong>, while we small people sneak in. He strongly advises against flying. An all-out assault would be very costly to them, so our cold boys can only do it once. Hypothetically that would draw most of the <strong>Obsidian's Cradle</strong> forces outside to defend the bridge, allowing us to get in. He suggests we <strong>scale</strong> the mountain instead of going through the main gate. It's about <strong>3000 feet</strong> up. Plex wants to be carried.</p><p>Fearghas suggests casting <strong>Wind Walk</strong> and hugging the ground. Plex suggests dressing up as rocks, also known as <strong>camouflage</strong>. I was thinking <strong>invisibility</strong> but I guess that's the budget option. Frengald says invisibility is no good here, creatures can sense us. Plex is distracted and looks for pebbles to glue onto himself. We discuss whether this is a time for <strong>Stone Whaleghas</strong> to shine, but he wouldn't be immune to fire so nope. The fortress is of course warded against teleportation spells.</p><p>Commander Frengald advises we don't worry about the giant lava worms, as they're harmless. We're probably way too small for them to notice us anyway. Plex suggests riding in the mouth of a giant lava worm. Fearghas suggests casting <strong>Planar Ally</strong>, or <strong>Conjure Elemental</strong>. Plex tries to bite Fearghas, but he is wearing armour. We think we can manage the climb even without too much magic, and plan the diversion with Frengald. Kyrin shows her sketch of the lava chamber with the fishing hole. Frengald is intrigued so she shows him the <strong>Sheeshah of Revelations</strong>. He says to put it away and keep it hidden, drugs are strictly forbidden in his camp. \"It's not drugs,\" she says. \"That's what they all say,\" he grumbles.</p><p>Plex <strong>Fey Steps</strong> into a small chest off to the side. Plonk! Then a small door opens into the chest and Plex walks back out. \"Sorry about that,\" he says casually. Plex-core. We go talk to the quartermaster in case he has any supplies he can spare. Aviana wants to buy 7 waterskins because it sure is hot in here. The quartermaster asks whether we are adventurers. We say yes, so he assumes we have a lot of gold and could be interested in an item he wants to get rid off. Keep talking, Emilio says. The giant asks if we have <strong>100.000 gold</strong>. Stop talking, Emilio says. Kyrin rolls a natural 1 on Performance, which turns into a dirty 23 by the power of <strong>Reliable Talent</strong>. Rogues, man.</p><p>We say we know someone with that much gold. The giant asks us to swear we won't tell anyone else. \"Is that a contract?\" Shalkoc asks. I want to hug this Dragonborn. He has learnt. We promise we won't tell anyone in this camp, after Plex grumbling it doesn't make any sense. The giant murmurs he might have acquired… a <strong>Decanter of Endless Water</strong>. In Muspelheim, that is precious indeed. But we do not have the muns. As we leave, he calls us back and says he can sell the Decanter for just 10.000. Fearghas is very suspicious. We ask whether the Decanter was stolen and this is why the quartermaster is so desperate to get rid of it. He refuses to talk about it… though he all but admits it under Fearghas' clever questioning.</p><p>Fearghas bargains his brains out, and when it fails he downright threatens the quartermaster. Kyrin covertly uses her <strong>Echo Stone</strong> to try to get evidence. After much grumbling and blackmailing and I-wish-I-had-a-candle, Fearghas buys the Decanter. NOW the quartermaster agrees to talk and claims he \"found\" the Decanter inside the camp. Emilio is muttering in the corner. Kyrin quietly palms 3 <strong>Potions of Force Resistance</strong>, 6 <strong>Potions of Heroism</strong>, and 5 <strong>Potions of Superior Healing</strong>. She gains inspiration for being sneaky sneaky, she did roll a dirty 20 with a 5 on the die. Rogues, man.</p><p>Shalkoc starts doing math on how much money we could make selling water on this plane. Aviana hands waterskins to everyone. Fearghas recasts <strong>Rary's Telepathic Bond</strong>; \"Alright everyone telepathic bond is up. Kyrin, did you get that on your rock?\" After we leave the camp, Kyrin shares her 5-finger-discount potions. We walk up to the volcano, and have to dodge <strong>boulders</strong> tumbling down the slopes. Behind us, a large lava shark has spotted us and is coming our way. I don't want to be shark snack, time to run!</p><p>Kyrin warns us about elementals that look like rocks but are a lot nastier (<strong>Cinderslag Elementals</strong>). The ground is also very unstable. By the gods, my legs are too short for this… We roll initiative for turn-based movement crossing the lava. Plex asks if we're in the <strong>Ethereal Plane</strong> and Fearghas' headache increases.</p><p><s>Karnack and Sobame trade candy</s>.</p><p>We see telegraphs for the falling boulders aaaaand we're all in the aoe. Aviana tries to spot hidden elementals, but all rocks look like rocks. She gets out of the aoe, chugs a <strong>Potion of Fire Resistance</strong>, and goes \"looking for traps the Barbarian way\". Fearghas and Shalkoc follow, though Shalkoc gets ahead and looks for anything suspicious, but all rocks once again look like rocks. A <strong>lava shark</strong> comes to say hello, how nice, but really a little too friendly for our taste. Emilio cracks his knuckles. Aviana cries out just before the shark jumps out of the lava, landing on top of her and Fearghas. Ouchie.</p><p>Fearghas is knocked prone, Aviana is pushed back, and she responds by using her <strong>Rod of Unwilling Retribution</strong>, forcing a DEX save. The shark fails and eats lightning damage. I dash out of the aoe and run up to Aviana, unfortunately that puts me very close to the lava shark so I drink up a <strong>Potion of Fire Resistance</strong> and hope for the best. Kyrin uses her bonus action to dash. Rogues, man.</p><p>Kyrin attacks the lava shark with a swing of the <strong>Sun Blade</strong> and it's a sneak attack for 45 damage. <s>Et bim</s>! A <strong>Cinderslag Elemental</strong> appears! Aviana shouts \"Guys, watch out!\" in our minds. It attacks Shalkoc and crits. BONK! Shalkoc is resistant to fire so he takes \"only\" 25 damage and falls prone. Emilio moves up, goes into Void Form, and uses <strong>Phase Shift</strong> to teleport up to the Cinderslag Elemental and slices him good. One hit, one miss, and 14 damage.</p><p>Plex casts <strong>Vortex Warp</strong> and swaps places with the Cinderslag Elemental. He appears in front of Emilio with claws raised. Then he casts <strong>Grasping Vine</strong> to grab Aviana and yoink her out of the aoe. The boulders come crashing down! Only the enemies get hit, Fearghas narrowly dodges. Aviana rages and grapples the lava shark, who is regretting being overly friendly. She grabs it real tight, and murders it. Then she uses <strong>Battering Ram</strong> on the confused Cinderslag Elemental. Kyrin telepathically cheers her on.</p><p>Fearghas blasts a <strong>Ray of Frost</strong> on the Cinderslag Elemental and we realise it's not vulnerable to frost damage, but it flinches from the steam. He climbs onto the corpse of the lava shark, Monster Hunter style, and guzzles a Potion of Heroism. And… it's one of the potions he got from the Blood Hags' lair! It's actually an <strong>Elixir of Corruption</strong>! He passes the CON save and resists the poison, but promises to feed Shalkoc that poison later so his breath can get a brand-new stink. Lovely.</p><p>Shalkoc forgets he can <strong>fly</strong> and casually walks up to Plex. We kindly remind him. He unfolds his wings, and does an aerial dash to another boulder just right of the path. I walk forward carefully and look around, anxious to <strong>spot</strong> enemies. I swear this rock we're standing on is looking at me funny! So I squeak a little bit, everyone shakes their heads, it's really just a rock.</p><p>Aviana gets crit. BAM <strong>Unflinching</strong>. She frightens the elemental, which earns her a thumbs up from Emilio. And that's a surge, blasting necrotic damage to all within 30 feet and coming back to her. And another surge right behind that, blinding her. The elemental proceeds to burrow into the rock, and get the hell out of here. Emilio <strong>Phase Shifts</strong> to the rock where Shalkoc and Kyrin are happily standing, and looks around to spot enemies. He has advantage in <strong>Void Form</strong> and spots another elemental chilling just ahead. Well toasting, rather. Roasting, even.</p><p>Plex uses his vine to drag Fearghas a little closer, and attempts a Blink spell but… no luck. <strong>A Series of Unfortunate Events</strong> triggers, and the Cinderslag Elemental <strong>duplicates</strong>! A boulder falls towards Plex! Sick dodges, he rolls a nat 20 on the DEX save and takes half damage, but loses concentration on <strong>Grasping Vine</strong>. The vine, which sweated and wilted as soon as it appeared, completely withers out of existence.</p><p>Aviana's voice echoes in the telepathic bond: \"Fearghas… Fearghas! Magic happened. I'm blind.\" She tries to find her way, decides to just <strong>charge</strong> straight ahead… right at Fearghas. She brakes 10 feet away from him. Fearghas tries to guide the poor harpy, in great part by getting out of her way. She does not know where north is. That's okay neither do I. Fearghas takes Aviana's hand to guide her, and pulls out the <strong>Decanter of Endless Water</strong>.</p><p>The two elementals up ahead are just punching each other, to very little effect. Shalkoc flies ahead and angers the rocks on the way. They swing at him, one misses but the other crits. I walk up to Aviana and touch her knee, casting <strong>Remove Curse</strong>. It's a bit of a flashbang but she is thrilled to see again! Kyrin uses Psychic Teleportation to get past the two fighting elementals. Emilio uses <strong>Netherwalk</strong>, followed by Phase Shift, and also runs past the elementals, stopping in between two aoes. He looks around to spot enemies, doesn't see shit, except of course for the two fighting rocks.</p><p>Plex casts <strong>Fey Step</strong>.</p><p>Oh boy.</p><p>A calculated risk.</p><p>He somehow does not end up in the lava.</p><p>He casts <strong>Vortex Warp</strong>, yoinking me to a spot behind Shalkoc. Wheeeeee! And then he disappears into the Ethereal Plane. However this gets me a little too close to a <strong>lava shark</strong> who looks very hungry for roasted potato. I dodge the <strong>Deadly Leap</strong> and take only 11 damage. I get knocked back… not into the lava. PHEW.</p><p>Fearghas asks Aviana to throw him, but \"don't tell the goblin.\" She obliges, grabs the dwarf, and <strong>CHARGES</strong>. She barrels into one of the elementals, and whacks him onto Emilio, who quietly swears in an unholy language from beyond the stars. Then she jumps, still holding Fearghas, and they crash on the other side of the lava shark that's looking at me funny. Fearghas proceeds to uncork the Decanter and blasts a geyser on the shark. <s>Oddly reminiscent of spraying a misbehaving cat with water</s>.</p><p>Emilio gets whacked and knocked prone, twice. Shalkoc flies back to punch the shark because he wants to know how it tastes. He goes into <strong>Mantis Style</strong>, then casually stuns the shark. A <strong>Flurry of Blows</strong> later, aaaaaand that's a major surge. Shalkoc is now a rabbit who can only move by <strong>jumping</strong> his maximum distance, which seems perfectly reasonable to him and no one can talk him out of it. NO ONE.</p><p>I slip around the shark to get out of the boulder aoe, draw my <strong>dagger</strong>… AND STAB THE THING TO DEATH. Always carry a sharp dagger, y'all. I may be a healer, BUT. Then Kyrin pulls out the <strong>Tinkertop Boltblaster 1000</strong> and fires at another shark, and marks the soul. Emilio gets scorched by just standing next to an elemental. He's distracted, prone, on fire… and very angry. He leaps up and starts slashing, then <strong>Phase Shifts</strong> away.</p><p>Plex pops back into reality. He <strong>Fey Steps</strong>, ends up on the very edge of a rock, flails with his arms and… dips his foot into the lava. Smells like grilled goblin suddenly. He reacts with <strong>Absorb Elements</strong>, reducing the damage, and scrambles backwards, jumping over rocks to get next to Emilio. Aviana runs over the rocks, looking around and feeling like… this one is giving me the side eye. Fearghas tiptoes past her. The elemental that got pushed into Emilio is now angry at him, and burrows to go and get a void-tainted snack. He misses and stands there awkwardly.</p><p>Shalkoc shifts to <strong>Turtle Stance</strong> and… with his wings out, he hops over the rocks like a happy bunny?! Aviana was not entirely wrong, the boulder was giving a side eye, but at Fearghas. It swings at him and misses, then burrows. I move up to Shalkoc and look around for the elemental, spot it still next to Fearghas. Kyrin teleports up to Fearghas, I telepathically point the spot where I last saw it, and she stands at the ready with the <strong>Sun Blade</strong>.</p><p>So anyway, Emilio started blasting. He grabs the elemental and yanks it closer, causing Plex to get scorched. He casts another Absorb Elements, then casts <strong>Shocking Grasp</strong> on the elemental who effortlessly dodges. Plex uses <strong>telekinesis</strong> to shove the elemental away, and runs up to me. Emilio takes a boulder to the face and gets <strong>dazed</strong>. Aviana gets scorched by the elemental's aura, takes it like a champ with <strong>Stone's Endurance</strong> and tries to grapple it but it's difficult to grab a bunch of burning rocks. Ah, whatever, she jumps on it instead. Then she charges up the mountain completely disregarding petty things such as gravity.</p><p>The angry elemental is still looking for Emilio but he is also <strong>dazed</strong> from the small matter of big boulder to the face. Fearghas is waterboarding the other elemental with the Decanter. Shalkoc jumps to it and <strong>breathes poison</strong> on it. This rock does not look too good… and Kyrin murders it with the Sun Blade in a feat of absolute overkill. Kyrin draws her bow and takes aim, readying to shoot the life out of the angry elemental. We telepathically shout at Emilio to leave this thing and get over here! But he shoots three <strong>Eldritch Blasts</strong> at it and kills it, but since he is dazed he can't move.</p><p>The last elemental is happy in the knowledge it is the real one, since its evil twin was killed. We are finally able to gather at the foot of the mountain. As we start to walk up, I treat my friends' burns. Aviana claims she has a scratch and wants healing too. I give her a little magic smooch and say she is fine. She wants to spend a girls' night out in the city… wait, we don't have a city yet, we're still building it.</p><p>The mountain is… really steep. Burning gas hisses out in places, boulders tumble down, and fiery monsters give us the side eye. Fearghas puts up <strong>Leomund's Tiny Hut</strong> so we can heal up and cook. Shalkoc is really uncomfortable with the jumping surge, we discuss it and decide I should <strong>cleanse</strong> it. I take a deep breath, remove the protection of my spellwards and place my hands on him. Drawing immense power through my body, I channel the most purifying spell into him and… <strong>HE TURNS GREEN</strong>. SHALKOC WHY ARE YOU GREEN. \"Naami what did you do to me,\" he cries. I shakily put my bracelets back on, close to tears from the sheer awe of the flood of magic fading from my mind… my friend changed colour. What even.</p><p>Aviana disappointedly puts away her chains, ropes, and manacles. Fearghas urges us to go up the mountain instead of tying up the now-green dragonborn. Shalkoc starts climbing, <strong>dodging</strong> falling rocks with ease. Kyrin rolls <strong>Survival</strong> to find a safer route, then <strong>Acrobatics</strong> to dodge falling rocks. She rolls a 2, Reliable Talent, dirty 20. Rogues, man.</p><p>My head is still spinning from that big spell… I roll <strong>Survival</strong>, fail to find a good route, roll <strong>Nature</strong> to dip into a vent to escape the falling rocks but misidentify the vent and stumble into poisonous gas. I pass the CON save only thanks to the <strong>Belt of Dwarvenkind</strong>, and take minor poison damage. Emilio is much luckier and sees the pattern of falling rocks. Fearghas slaps <strong>Guidance</strong> on himself, <s>fights his cat who sat her bum on the mouse</s>, and rolls Survival and <strong>Investigation</strong> to find a spot to take cover.</p><p>Aviana is the only one who didn't dump <strong>Strength</strong> and she ZOOMS up the mountain by sheer power of biceps. Plex gives a good look at the rocks, hides behind a rocky outcrop, and takes no damage. Shalkoc fails to dodge the falling rocks, but uses <strong>inspiration</strong> to turn it into a success! Kyrin absolutely dances out of the way. Rogues, man.</p><p>I get into another puff of toxic gas, my eyes are streaming and I'm coughing but I'm fine, trust. Plex casts <strong>Adjust Density</strong> to make Emilio lighter, but despite that he doesn't get anywhere because his arms are noodles. He does dodge the rocks and earns Aviana's respect for attempting the <strong>Athletics</strong> check. Fearghas scrabbles up with the power of Guidance, but gets hit by a rock and tumbles back down, shouting Dwarven curses all the way. He starts arguing with Aviana in the telepathic bond so they scream back and forth in all our heads…</p><p>Aviana <strong>flexes</strong>, then gets hit by two rocks for her trouble. Plex is happy to see Aviana coming back for him because he was feeling a bit lost and confused. Plex did not think things through, but he is inspired so he re-thinks his life choices. It does not go well. He casts <strong>Mold Earth</strong> to shield himself from incoming rocks. Shalkoc is bathing in the toxic gas, enjoying the smell. She dances past Shalkoc who is sitting there sauna-style… wait where did he get the towel?!</p><p>With impressive consistency, I once again dodge into a toxic vent and inhale poisonous gas. It burns my throat… I'm tougher than that, and catching up to Shalkoc. Emilio is right on my heels and climbs up to me with the power of Guidance and a high Wisdom score. Fearghas squints at the rocks real hard, and sees all the way into the Weave with a 28. Aviana casts <strong>Resistance</strong> and once more zooms up the mountain with her legendary strength, then rolls a nat 20 on Acrobatics, catching up to Kyrin.</p><p>Plex is struggling to keep up, but he manages to hide from the rocks and joins me and Emilio. Shalkoc takes two rocks to the face and falls, zooming past us on his way down. He lands next to Fearghas, pretty beat up. Meanwhile Kyrin is casually climbing and <strong>close to the top</strong>. Rogues, man.</p><p>True to myself, I get into the poison again but roll a nat 20 on the save. Well I still take damage but it's minor. Emilio takes a rock right on the nose and tumbles down, he really has problems with <strong>Strength saves</strong>…</p><p>Fearghas: <strong>Polymorph</strong> is the solution to all of life's problems.</p><p>Plex: YESSSSSSS turn into a GOAT.</p><p>DM, the devil on his shoulder: A goat gets +10 to all the checks.</p><p>Fearghas resists the evil that is goats and rolls <strong>Investigation</strong> again. Aviana claims her pride demands she rolls <strong>Athletics</strong>, proceeds to roll a 3, but gets a nat 20 on the Nature check and gets into the vent right next to mine, which is safe, and I'm sitting here crying in the poison. \"Why are you sitting over here, this one is the safe one,\" she says. I cough and sneeze in response. Plex gets it, he ducks into the poison as well but takes major damage and gets <strong>poisoned</strong>.</p><p>Shalkoc gets into the poison sauna again. Kyrin easily gets to the top of the volcano and peers into it. I want to heal Plex but can't see him, so I climb up and hope he can make it up as well. THIS TIME I can smell the poison from a mile away. A-HA! This vent is safe! I huddle happily as the rocks tumble past. Emilio fumbles on <strong>Survival</strong> and takes a rock to the face. He's pretty badly bruised. Fearghas once more resists the temptation to <strong>Polymorph</strong> into a giant goat, hops into a poisonous vent, and casts <strong>Resistance</strong> to pass the CON save.</p><p>Aviana scuttles up the mountain like some lava monkey, joining Kyrin at the top. Plex is now rolling with disadvantage because of the poison and he makes slow progress, taking more damage on the way. I get to the top and peer inside! Ooooh intimidating. Emilio rolls a natural 20 and easily dodges the rocks. Fearghas <strong>Guidances</strong> himself up, gets into poisonous gas, and he is poisoned. Aviana is posing and flexing at the top of the mountain, how like her.</p><p>Plex uses <strong>Mold Earth</strong> again to shield himself from all damage. Shalkoc makes it to the top in pretty rough shape. Emilio is catching up but it is not his day. The two wizards make it up, and Emilio is last to join us. Shalkoc pulled out snacks and is grilling skewers over the lava. The crater is massive, 3000 feet radius, and nested inside is an immense fortress. Aviana's harpy eyes see… \"a rainbow-fire-elemental-that-looks-like-a-human\". We assume it's one of the <strong>arcane golems</strong>. And \"a lot of black people standing on the walls ready to throw <strong>Fireballs</strong>.\" Aha. Something about metal statues made of spikes? Nobody knows what she is talking about.</p>"

          "content": "<p><strong>Monday, 16</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> of Undecimus, 1497</strong></p><p><strong>1:30</strong></p><p>The climb down into the caldera looks about as bad as the climb up the mountain was. We peer inside, spotting a lot of hostiles; fire giants, elementals, and <strong>warlocks of Imix</strong>. The rainbow people Aviana was talking about are hovering above the castle. Plex seems to be out of paint, to his despair as he wanted to camouflage himself by painting rock texture on his body. Aviana suggests shoving a rock down Plex' throat instead. We decide to contact <strong>Frengald</strong> to let him know to start his diversion, and Fearghas wants to put up the dome so we can heal for a little bit.</p><p>Plex finds us a lovely little cave to hide in, the small issue is the <strong>entrance</strong> is barely bigger than Plex-size. Not an issue for me or Kyrin who is slender, but Fearghas pushing himself through makes a lot of screeching noises when his armour scrapes against the rock. He puts up <strong>Leomund's Tiny Hut</strong>. Shalkoc whips up some <strong>unspiced hardtack</strong> to help us heal, Aviana requests liver paste but we are out so she suggests eating Fearghas' <strong>liver</strong> instead. Both Fearghas and me disagree, but then Fearghas gets a surge that <strong>deafens</strong> him, and he enjoys the silence a little too much. Plex rejoices, now he can steal Fearghas' liver. The dwarf promptly begins grumbling and Shalkoc distracts the goblin with <strong>chocolate biscuits</strong>.</p><p>We assume it will take about 2 hours for the wizards to climb down into the caldera, though Kyrin would be much faster. Being relatively safe, we decide to take a <strong>short rest</strong> and sleep through the night.</p><hr><p><strong>Monday, 16</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> of Undecimus, 1497</strong></p><p><strong>9:45</strong></p><p><strong>Short rest</strong></p><p>In the morning, I cast a <strong>Wellspring of Life</strong> to heal us all up, after the best night Fearghas ever spent. When the healing touches him, it cures his deafness and immediately Aviana's yapping returns to his ears, making him very sad. As the Wellspring heals us, Fearghas casts Blood Barrier, drawing blood from Aviana, Kyrin, and Emilio to grant himself a large amount of temporary HP. Emilio's blood is black?!</p><p>Turns out Emilio was bad at going up the mountain, but he is very good at going back down the mountain. Shalkoc whips up <strong>hardtack with even less spices</strong> to grant the rest of us temp HP. It's so crumbly… Aviana applies <strong>Abyssal Nail Polish</strong>, and receives the <strong>Wolf Spirit's Blessing</strong>, which will allow her to be the damsel in distress while Emilio is blasting left right and centre (as he does). <s>Fearghas bullies me</s>.</p><p>I use a spell scroll of <strong>Sending</strong> to let Frengald know we are about one hour's travel from the bridge, inside the caldera. He responds he will start the attack on the fortress so we can slink in. Fearghas puts up <strong>Rary's Telepathic Bond</strong>. We all attempt to sneak in, but even with the power of <strong>Guidance</strong>, Fearghas is bumping down the mountain clanking and yelping. Plex exclaims something in <s>the butt language</s> Sylvan and Aviana replies \"Who are you calling a cooked chicken?!\"</p><p>Somehow we don't attract attention, but we're not about to question divine intervention. Aviana grabs and chokes Plex, as usual, and Emilio shouts a warning that an \"arrow\" is coming our way. Plex has no chance to dodge as he is struggling to breathe. Aviana holds him up as a shield. The rest of us have sick dodges and a second later a <strong>ballista shot</strong> the size of a tree trunk cleaves the ground where we stood just a heartbeat ago. Now we have attracted attention, clearly, and Plex has to get a large splinter out of himself.</p><p>We venture onto the bridge, have no choice but to cross it. The first gate is not part of the fortress but instead a gatehouse. We drink our <strong>Potions of Fire Resistance</strong>, anticipating… fiery resistance to our intrusion. Kyrin is super stealthy, hiding behind Aviana and Plex. Only 30 feet below us, lava churns. One of the rainbow people, <strong>Manastorm Golem</strong>, is floating 90 feet above ground by the guardhouse's wall to our right.</p><p>Kyrin suggests sneaking us all in with the Portable Hole. We discuss sniping the one golem. Oh well, initiative it is. Aviana could use a mythic power to jump up, the wizards could cast Dimension Door, we could all fight. The <strong>Fire Giant</strong> on top of the gatehouse wall has spotted us for sure. Plex casts <strong>Arcane Gate</strong>, placing the other one on top of the wall. Stepping through, he uses Telekinesis to push the giant through the portal, which surprisingly works! I channel <strong>Hold Monster</strong> through Lioriel's staff and as the Fire Giant woman struggles in vain agains the spell, I mentally yell at my friends to GET HER!</p><p>Kyrin steps up and slices and dices with the <strong>Sun Blade</strong> (guaranteed crit thanks to paralysis), but then a major surge teleports her all the way to Plex. She steps through the portal, returning to her spot, and adds a <strong>Psychic Blade</strong> to the damage. Emilio casts <strong>Eldritch Blast</strong> so that's 3 crits, with 9d12 from Aviana's <strong>Hamstringing</strong>. \"And that's what we call an overkill,\" Aerelia says as Karnack chants \"Dice! Dice! Dice!\" Very little remains of the Fire Giant, mainly a lot of blood. Emilio skips through the portal to see what Plex sees. He sees another warlock casting a Fireball at him and Plex, who casts Absorb Elements. They take light damage and Plex loses concentration on the Arcane Gate.</p><p>Fearghas grabs me and casts <strong>Dimension Door</strong> to get us on top of the gatehouse. Wheeeeeee! The golem spots us and fires a <strong>Draining Bolt</strong> at me, sucking the spell slots out of me?! I use an inspiration to reroll my save and barely pass it! The golem ducks behind cover, which makes Fearghas angry. By the fortress a <strong>Fire Giant Dreadnought</strong> wielding 2 tower shields is guarding the gate and it sprints to us, then jumps up and lands right in front of Fearghas and me.</p><p>Aviana does a little jump and lands closer to the main gate. Plex assumes the rest of us have matters well in hand, how foolish. He casts <strong>Ice Knife</strong>, hitting Fearghas and me as well. Plex tries to <strong>hide</strong>, rolls a natural 1, he is convinced he is very well hidden indeed. I'm mindful of my teammates so I skirt around the giant to put distance between me and Fearghas, then cast <strong>Sword Burst</strong>, dealing minor damage. Kyrin uses <strong>Psychic Teleportation</strong>, then hides and I have no idea where she is.</p><p>Emilio is also mindful of this teammates and carefully excludes me from the radius of his Void Grenade (<strong>Abhorrent Apparition</strong>). Then he aura farms. One warlock atop the fortress wall shoots a <strong>Fireball</strong> at us. Fearghas and me dodge for half damage but Emilio takes the full blast. Fearghas chugs a proper, non-Hag Potion of Heroism, then casts Shocking Grasp but misses despite the advantage, such sad times we live through.</p><p>The <strong>Manastorm Golem</strong> peeks from behind the wall, shoots a <strong>Draining Bolt</strong> at me, misses (phew) and ducks back behind cover. The <strong>Dreadnought</strong> charges, pushing Fearghas and Emilio and knocking them both prone. He also slaps Emilio with his shields, and as a bonus action jumps to get closer to Plex (who still thinks himself well-hidden). Aviana jumps so perfectly, her thunder damage hits EVERYONE (enemy and allies). Plex considers <em>intercepting</em> her with his <strong>Rocket Straps </strong>but realises considering the size of Aviana, it's likely a bad idea.</p><p>Aviana happily slaps a crit on the Dreadnought but it raises its shields, blocking the blow. Plex casts a <strong>Shocking Grasp</strong> which hits, dealing big damage thanks to his <strong>Sneaky Spellshite's Amulet</strong>. And that's overkill?! I dash in an attempt to hide behind Aviana, but my legs are too short to run all this way. Kyrin teleports, still so well-hidden none of us knows where she is (Plex could never) and pulls out the <strong>Tinkertop Boltblaster</strong> to light up the golem.</p><p>Emilio jumps to his feet and readies an Eldritch Blast for the Manastorm Golem. In the meantime we take another Fireball to the face; Plex uses Absorb Elements and only Aviana dodges it. Fearghas gets up and moves up to Emilio; he summons his <strong>Spectral Hand</strong> and then readies to cast <strong>Revelation Through Battle</strong> on the golem. The golem pops up, proceeds to take 3 Eldritch Blasts to the face, somehow is not dead yet so Emilio yanks him 10 feet closer, just in range for Kyrin. Fearghas takes one look at the golem, mutters \"that's mean\". The golem is immune against anything except force, and resistant to physical damage. It slaps Kyrin, she dodges by sucking in the belly and bending the back, masterful Rogue moves indeed.</p><p>Kyrin whacks the golem with the Sun Blade but it takes no damage at all. Aviana rages and crouches, readying a jump. Plex casts <strong>Adjust Density</strong> on Aviana to make her lighter and she immediately leaps, soaring like a very large chicken and landing with a bang. I give Emilio a lv 1 <strong>Cure Wounds</strong>, a little afraid to start burning (more) sorcery points. Kyrin <strong>shoots</strong> the golem and it plummets towards the lava, dissipating before it can touch the surface. Emilio climbs down the wall to the bridge below.</p><p>More elementals are flying around, keeping an eye on us but not attacking or coming close enough to risk getting shot by us. Fearghas goes down through the hatch. I follow him and oh gods the giant-sized stairs are a CHALLENGE. The size of the ballista bolts stored here makes this room look like a logging camp. We walk up to the gate, and Fearghas tells Plex to use the <strong>Instant Door</strong>! Sadly it does not work, but this sets a precedent of Fearghas approving the use of Plex's magic key. Aviana has no use for things like keys as she leaps up to the battlements.</p><p>Aviana finds a heavy lever and pulls on it to try to open the portcullis, but only gets it stuck. She tosses down a rope so we can climb. From up on the battlements, we see a <strong>giant staircase</strong> in the middle of the courtyard, leading down. There are no warlocks in sight… we suspect an <strong>ambush</strong>, and hurry to the stairs. Plex licks his finger, sticks it up, estimates the giants' battle will take about <strong>10 hours</strong>. Kyrin offers to scout and look for the warlock of Imix who retreated while the rest of us go on ahead down the stairs.</p><p>We realise, hang on a second, these stairs are WAY <strong>oversized</strong> even for giants. 10 giants could walk down here side-by-side. Kyrin is scouting a torchlit hallway that seems to lead to a forge or smithy. The walls are very decorated with murals depicting a <strong>giant flame</strong> surrounded by smaller giants. Concerning… We find nothing but siege engines up on the wall, so we decide to climb down. As we walk through the buildings, we see living quarters through the windows. As we walk past one of the buildings, we smell burning incense… Drawn by the strange smell, I investigate but it is coming from the first floor. Plex pulls out the Instant Door… and a surge <strong>silences</strong> us all. Oh we can still think to one another but casting spells is off the table for the next hour.</p><p>We find a simple bedroom, though all the furniture is made of metal. We find the incense on the table and it's… reasonably-sized?! Clearly not made by giants. We find 4 <strong>Incense of Recovery (Minor)</strong>! Plex wants to use them to cover his sneaking so I do a bit of yelling at the goblin. I take 2 of them and each wizard takes one, just in case they eat up all their arcane recovery charges I guess? In the meantime Kyrin is on her own adventure, triggers a trap but dodges, finds an audience hall, finds alcohol and smoked food. She warns us of <strong>tripwires</strong>.</p><p>We decide to go down the stairs to rejoin with Kyrin. What's odd is… none of us has seen anyone since the battle ended. We meet up in the council hall; big table with 6 chairs, one of them knocked over as if in haste. On the table are stone slabs engraved with runes and a chisel. These runes aren't Giant, none of us understands them. Fearghas prepares to cast Comprehend Languages but Aviana takes ONE peek at the slabs and says \"Well obviously that's written in <strong>Ignan</strong>, the Fire Elemental language, you can tell by the scorch marks. I still can't read it though.\" We realised although the tablets are written in Ignan, they are signed in Giant by one <strong>High Priest Vrummohr</strong>.</p><p>Fearghas casts <strong>Comprehend Languages</strong> and reads an exchange between some kind of Fire Elemental royal figure named Ignatio and the Fire Giants; a demand to return a stolen artefact. The Fire Elementals threaten the Giants to return the chains within three months, as they are part of the prison of a god. If they are not returned, grave danger will befall every plane of existence. The Fire Giants' response accuses <strong>Ignatio</strong> of lying; the Giants claim they received the chains from <strong>Surtr</strong> himself.</p><p>Kyrin is very restless, and ghosts down the stairs to <strong>scout</strong> as the rest of us take a break in the <strong>larder</strong>, nibbling on the food but mostly waiting out the silence surge. Emilio looks murderous, and confirms in the telepathic link that yes he is in fact always looking to kill things. N-not helping… I hesitantly go to fix him up while Plex discusses options to <strong>poison</strong> the Giants.</p><p>Kyrin tiptoes on ill-fitting metal plates barely covering lava beneath. She finds a <strong>shield</strong> with a wooden front but metal lining, covered in arrow and javelin holes. She also finds a <strong>chapel</strong> with murals, and beckons us in, so we join her there. Before we leave the council hall, Plex makes a door in three of the chair legs because… just because.</p><p>I roll a natural 1 on <strong>Religion</strong> and I am sure Imix is actually a Fire Elemental cast out for being too hot, and so it came to the Fire Giants who appreciated Imix' hotness and started revering him, which made Surtr jealous. Fearghas mutters this sounds like \"one of Aviana's books\". I insist it makes a lot of sense, and vehemently deny reading Aviana's books. He rolls a 25 on <strong>Insight</strong> against my 2 on <strong>Deception</strong> and gives me a blank stare. Is… is it obvious on my face that I um… borrowed one of Aviana's books? Oh dear…</p><p>We have to remind Plex that we are below a <strong>lava lake</strong> and opening random doors in the walls or ceiling may not be a great idea. Or at least it is a feat he could only do once. We find some oddities in the murals; one depicts mortals drawn tiny next to the giants, bringing gifts to <strong>Imix</strong>: books, scrolls, and gems. I notice a lot of <strong>burnt blood</strong> on the altar, most of it old. Fearghas places a pyrope on the altar. In the reflection of the gem, he sees us but it looks like our eyes are red and we seem creepy and greedy…? Plex decides to experiment and place a <strong>fork</strong> of <em>fine quality</em> on the altar. Nothing happens.</p><p>Fearghas picks up the pyrope again, but oddly it feels like stealing. Plex feels nothing of the sort as he retrieves his fork. I roll a natural 20 on <strong>Medicine</strong> and identify the blood as Fire Giant blood, some of it spilled less than 30 minutes ago! Kyrin has 0 fear and climbs up on the altar then slices her hand to spill blood on the altar. We all get near-blinded as Kyrin is engulfed in flames… and <strong>disappears</strong>. We don't hear her in the telepathic bond anymore. Fearghas replicates the ritual, and the same happens to him. Aviana grabs Plex and chokes him, then slices into him. His blood goes up in flames but he remains in Aviana's hand. At my urging she releases the goblin, who defends himself with <strong>Jim's Lance of Compensation</strong>, which sadly does not reach.</p><p>Just as Plex tries to stab Aviana again, he goes up in flames and vanishes. I ask Aviana to boost me up to the altar. I cut into my arm to drop blood onto the altar, and I am whisked away as well. Aviana follows after me and we all find ourselves in a large circular cavern. A big stone platform rises in the middle. The only exit is a pathway to the side, leading to a smaller cavern. The passage looks well-used, lined with braziers lit by a burning orange sphere. Kyrin steps out of the shadows, and Fearghas recasts <strong>Rary's Telepathic Bond</strong>, which had just ran out.</p><p>We walk down the pathway and hear an agitated discussion between 6 people, in Giant, up ahead. \"Unfortunate timing for intruders to come in, with the Frost Giants attacking. The entrances to the library and the treasury have been sealed. The master has ordered to not seal the entrance to the core chamber. The giants decide to go set an <strong>ambush</strong> into the entrance chamber. We decide quickly to out-ambush their ambush! Fearghas generously offers himself up as bait.</p><p>Plex, Kyrin, and myself drink our <strong>Potions of Heroism</strong>. Aviana casts <strong>Death Ward</strong> on Emilio, and then drinks <strong>Bugman's Ale</strong>. Plex casts <strong>Mold Earth</strong>, presumably to hide, and only manages to trigger a major surge: for a WEEK, every door will slam shut behind him and become locked. Fearghas readies <strong>Globe of Invulnerability</strong>. Plex is thinking in terms of goblin engineering, trying to devise catapults around his major surge.</p><p>We roll initiative, and <strong>A Series of Unfortunate Events</strong> happens! So Plex… how do they die? \"Is there a door nearby?\" Plex asks confidently. It's a cave. There is no door. \"What's the big stone called from the Indiana Jones movies, the big boulder?\" A perfectly circular boulder drops from the ceiling, crashes down perfectly between 2 giants, one panicks and runs and the boulder rolls after him, picking up speed on the flat floor of this perfectly stable cave, and flattens the giant. The others come out and see Fearghas standing in the open, casting <strong>Globe of Invulnerability</strong> around him.</p><p>Plex readies a <strong>Silence</strong> spell. Kyrin readies to assassinate one of the last giants. One <strong>War Mage</strong> dashes forward, followed by a <strong>Dreadnought</strong> who jumps forward and spots Emilio and Aviana, charges them, steps on me on its way and both Emilio and me also fall <strong>prone</strong>. Ouch… Fearghas casts <strong>Command</strong> on the Dreadnought and orders it to Halt and take no actions next turn. It rolls a natural 1 on the save! The lich hand flicks him on the nose, saying BAD!! and the giant is so stunned, he has no idea what to do with himself. Aviana <strong>rages</strong> and attempts to grapples the Dreadnought, earning an inspiration for the wrestling contest! He breaks out of the grapple, so she slashes at him with perfectly painted nails.</p><p>Another <strong>War Mage</strong> walks up and casts <strong>Scorching Ray</strong> on Aviana but only 2 out of 6 hit. I move the previously placed <strong>Wellspring of Life</strong> (trust) to cover me and Emilio, and cast <strong>Cone of Cold</strong> on the Dreadnought, but he passes the save and takes only minor damage. Another Dreadnought appears and charges Plex in his bunker who succeeds on the STR save?!</p><p>The Wellspring heals Emilio, who gets up from the ground and activates <strong>Void Form</strong> and starts attacking with <strong>Reaping Claws</strong>. The giant raises his shields and blocks, but Emilio attacks again, connecting this time. Kyrin attacks with the Sun Blade, but hits a <strong>Shield</strong> spell. Plex pulls out \"<strong>Smoke Granades</strong>\" and chucks one in the middle of the pathway, creating a cloud of pitch-black spores, on top of his Silence spell. He shoves his Dreadnought into the cloud of spores with Telekinesis and forces him prone with <strong>Crushing Impact</strong>.</p><p>Kyrin attacks with the Sun Blade, then uses <strong>Phantom Pain</strong> for more damage. She hides with a 32 on strealth, the giants are scrambling to find whatever little rat bit them and they cannot see it?! A War Mage steps through the passageway and casts <strong>Dispel Magic</strong> to remove the Command on the Dreadnought. Emilio reacts with <strong>Counterspell</strong>, but the same War Mage uses her reaction to cast… <strong>Counterspell</strong>. Emilio threatens the War Mage but she doesn't understand Common and Fearghas understands her saying in Giant \"what is that pipsqueak saying?\".</p><p>The Dreadnought with the Command dispelled identifies a healer and bashes me in the face. This allows Aviana to use <strong>Coordinated Hunt</strong>, giving Emilio a free attack and he crits! The Dreadnought's attacks on me miss, but he steps into my healing spell… Joke's on you, it heals at the beginning of your turn and I'm about to move it move it. The Warlock of Imix understands by communicating with her allies that Emilio is a THREAT and casts <strong>Banishment</strong> on him. He passes the save with negative issues, rolling a 28 and all.</p><p>Fearghas casts <strong>Chain Lightning</strong>! IT'S A CRIT!! 20d8?! \"Listen Fearghas,\" says Aviana, \"hit me. Just fcking FRY me. I'm the conduit!\" He's popping inspirations to re-roll failed attack rolls, and hits every target, triggering Aviana's <strong>Unflinching</strong>. The harpy explodes, the Warlock next to her keels over and dies. Fearghas slaps <strong>Toll the Dead</strong> on the Dreadnought, which also dies. \"Is that enough firepower for you Plex?\" Fearghas asks.</p><p>Aviana grabs at the War Mage. She understands the mage shouting at her allies to run, and then she starts to pray without defending herself. Aviana drags the terror-stricken mage to Emilio, but as she jumps and lands, the <strong>thunder</strong> damage kills the mage. Aviana proceeds to crit the Dreadnought and bites him through the heavy armour. She somehow murders the Dreadnought and proceeds to apologise profusely to Emilio for stealing his kill. The harpy is having a really good time showering in blood. Emilio isn't judging her.</p><p>The last War Mage alive is out of sight and just blasts a <strong>Fireball</strong> in our general direction. Kyrin dodges it, taking no damage. The giant shouts something Kyrin can't understand, and starts backing off. Kyrin tells us through telepathy were the last giant is, but I can neither see her nor get to her, so I defend myself as Emilio dashes towards the mage. He uses <strong>Netherwalk</strong>, then <strong>Eldritch Energies</strong>, slapping an Eldritch Blast on the last giant. The mage <strong>Counterspells</strong> in panic. Plex Fey Steps into the Wellspring, lights his pipe, and sits down to chill. We're still in combat.</p><p>Kyrin attacks with her Psychic Blade, but it's not enough yet. Fearghas dashes up to the spore cloud. Aviana slurps up some blood, bathing in the Wellspring. The giant mage casts <strong>Misty Step</strong>, Emilio <strong>Counterspells</strong>, she Counterspells, Misty Step goes off and she dashes, fleeing from us. I return to the Wellspring, trying to ignore Aviana's barbaric moment of triumph. Years of practicing medicine, my stomach is too strong for a little (well, a lot really) blood, and I almost wish it wasn't.</p><p>Emilio blasts the mage and drags her closer, chasing with <strong>Phase Shift</strong>. Kyrin shoots a <strong>Tanglefoot Arrow</strong>. The mage rolls a natural 1 on the save and is slowed. Fearghas joins the chase as he moves through the spore cloud. Dwarves being natural-born sprinters, he dashes after our fast and murderous friends. The mage is still trying to run and <strong>Misty Steps</strong> away. Emilio chases with more <strong>Eldritch Blasts</strong>; she Shields. Kyrin shoots and misses, then steps into the shadows.</p><p>I hear Emilio and Kyrin's thoughts, feel their desire to kill. I can sense their bloodlust and I want nothing more than to cut my mind off from the telepathic bond. Primal fear makes me try to silence my thoughts, they wouldn't hurt me would they? We're friends. My friends are giving their all to kill a creature that is desperately running from them… Kyrin thinks to Fearghas, \"Yell at her we won't stop the chase, she might as well stand and fight! I don't speak Giant, tell her!\" I want to cover my ears, if only it could stop the voices. Kyrin's anger overpowers all her thoughts. Emilio is all instinct, no emotion.</p><p>Still chasing the mage, Emilio rounds a corner into a big cavern full of piles of gold, a veritable <strong>hoard</strong> of gold. The mage runs into this cavern screaming for help. Emilio relays her screams to the rest of us and we realise she is screaming for help… in <strong>Draconic</strong>. Emilio casts another Eldritch Blast and yanks the mage back, but does not succeed in killing her yet. He does get a surge making him faster for a week, and by the sound of Fearghas shouting in all our heads to GET OUT OF HERE NOW, he will need it.</p><p><s>Plex is painting with blood and rolls a natural 20</s>.</p><p>Kyrin sneaks up to the injured mage, rolls a natural 20 with her bow, and shoots THE ARROW OF DESTINY. It takes the giant in the back of the head, sends her tumbling forward and into one of the gold piles, scattering the coins in a shower of metallic noise and then… silence.</p>"

Shalkoc cooks <strong>unspiced hardtack</strong>, tastes like hit points. Aviana suggests eating Fearghas' liver, Plex agrees, I yell at them. Fearghas is deafened by a surge and enjoys the best night of his life as we take a short rest and he is free of our yapping.</p>\n<p>Monday morning rolls around and I heal up the rest of our wounds, accidentally making Fearghas hear again and he is very sad. Fearghas requests volunteers for a little bloodletting, Emilio's blood is black, I'm sure that's nothing to worry about. We eat hardtack with somehow even less spices, Shalkoc are you okay? Aviana does her nails, and I contact <strong>Frengald</strong> who responds he will start his attack on the fortress. Plex calls Aviana a cooked chicken, she is not too happy.</p>\n<p>We try to sneak in but the bridge over the lava lake has 0 cover so Plex gets shot by a giant ballista, on account on Aviana using him as a shield. We fight at a gatehouse, I paralyse a fire giant so everyone can beat her up. Overkill! But there are more enemies, including one of the rainbow golems and it's <strong>sucking the spell slots out of me</strong>?! War crime. The biggest threat this campaign has ever seen. I squeak MY SPELL SLOTS and Kyrin says, \"hmmm Fearghas sounded very female just now?\"</p>\n<p>We do some more fighting against a giant with two shields, Emilio is aura farming, Fearghas drinks a proper non-Hag potion, we have a difficult time getting the golem but Kyrin puts an arrow in it and it dissipates.

Down the stairs, we find a council hall. Aviana the scholar spots stone slabs on the table and says they are <em>obviously</em> written in <strong>Ignan</strong>, you can tell by the scorch marks.

Ignatio demands the return of <strong>Rovagug's chains</strong> as they are part of the prison of a god of destruction. Vrummohr calls Ignatio a liar and claims the chains are a gift from Surtr himself. This is what we call foreshadowing. We take a little break in a nearby larder and nibble on the Fire Giants' food like we are rats. To them, we are probably rats.</p>\n<p>Kyrin leads us to a chapel where I read interesting things in the murals and Fearghas says it sounds like one of <strong>Aviana's books</strong>. I deny. He rolls 25 on Insight against my 2 on Deception. Fine, I borrowed one of Aviana's books, is it my fault if these murals make Imix look so hot?? Books aside, we investigate the altar and find out it can teleport us away!

          "content": "<p><strong>Monday, 16th of Undecimus, 1497</strong></p><p><strong>11:30</strong></p><p>As the Fire Giant falls dead into a pile of gold, the ground and walls rumble with a deep <strong>growl</strong>. Kyrin hides to sneakily check on the situation, but Emilio strategically decides to book it. Kyrin describes the room to us telepathically; <strong>islands floating in lava</strong>, one large and four small, some stairs at the back, four pillars on the main island. Plex and Aviana are arguing about how blood-bathing should be done, Fearghas shouts \"This is not the time for —\", Aviana grabs Plex by the throat, and they both <strong>disappear</strong>.</p><p>Kyrin is extremely sneaky and scouts the cave a little more. The roof is high up, the islands reach about a hundred feet out of the lava. Kyrin sends us a question, none of us hear it… We figure out pretty quickly something is interfering with the <strong>telepathic bond</strong>, and Fearghas marches off to look for her. We all follow into a room bursting with <strong>treasure</strong>… Shalkoc's eyes go saucer-wide, and even though I can't see Kyrin, I feel her little thieving heart rejoice. Fearghas calls Kyrin in a whisper, then we find the barrier messing with our telepathy.</p><p>Kyrin teleports to the island to our right and picks up something. Runes on the pillars start to glow, filling the cavern in a blinding light. We are forcefully <strong>teleported</strong> into another cavern with matching runes… in mid-air above a bubbling lake of lava. Fearghas casts <strong>Fly</strong> from a spellgem. I scream for Shalkoc to grab me and his <strong>wings</strong> pop into existence. Fearghas grabs Emilio, Shalkoc grabs me, Kyrin <strong>teleports</strong> and we safely land on the nearby rocky outcropping. In front of us are bones, a circular <strong>altar </strong>covered in old blood, and two <strong>sarcophagi</strong> behind it.</p><p>Funerary urns surround the altar. Fearghas flies over the altar, I start going around it, Emilio steps onto it. We hear a sound like an exhale, not unlike <strong>Shalkoc's fire-breath</strong>. The walls shake, then go still. Emilio walks across the altar unharmed, we are all spooked. Emilio is frosty as can be, examines the altar for a <strong>mechanism</strong>, rolls a natural 1. He yanks out a brick that seemed out of place… and they all tumble like dominos, the altar crumbling, leaving our warlock standing here with one brick in his hand. Fearghas examine the sarcophagi, there is <strong>Draconic</strong> script on them but he can't make sense of any words. The top is sculpted with a <strong>Dragonborn</strong> skull.</p><p>Shalkoc licks it, tastes old. I try to dissuade Fearghas from opening the left sarcophagus, saying we should let the dead rest. Naturally, he <strong>opens</strong> it. Kyrin is sneaking up ahead, though we agree the time for subtlety is long past. She comes to a metal <strong>gate</strong> with tiny holes in it, too small even for her hand to pass through. There is another sarcophagus beyond it. Fearghas casts Detect Magic, sensing <strong>necromancy</strong> from inside the coffins, and remains of other magic on the (former) altar. As he opens it, the necromantic ward inside activates and a clawed skeletal hand rises up, helping him push the lid up. The skeletal remains of a big Dragonborn-like, <strong>quadrupedal</strong> creature, rises from the grave.</p><p>The creature speaks in Draconic, which Fearghas and Shalkoc understand (and translate for us). Shalkoc casually starts chatting with the dead guy, asking how long he was asleep. \"I was entombed not long after <strong>Imix' exile</strong>,\" he says, then adds he is (was?) a <strong>priest of Tiamat</strong>. Oh shit. Fearghas carefully says we're not followers or enemies of Tiamat. The undead deducts we are grave-robbers. N-nooooo. We say the year is 1497, and the undead says it makes no sense and our brains must be cooked.</p><p>Shalkoc learns other races used to serve Dragonborn and he wants to go back in time. He let slip he was a leader of a village, then went \"oop\". Fearghas asks why this guy is buried under a Fire Giant fortress in Muspelheim. \"This should be Imix' fortress, in <strong>Imix' Jaws</strong>!\" Aha… it's called Surtr's Jaws now… Our undead guy is very confused; he died in the year 3741, when Fire Giants were slaves of dragon folk! Fearghas launches into a lecture of dwarven history for our man <strong>Xurvanthrax</strong>, who first wakes up his friend <strong>Sulythas</strong> (and not Silithus).</p><p>To Fearghas' credit, he covers a lot. The undeads ask if the <strong>Dragon Empire</strong> fell aeons ago, and if \"lesser\" races rule now. Fearghas confirms, yea dragons are pretty much myth and legend now. They are aghast; that goes against the will of Tiamat! They ask where Imix the god of fire is, but we don't know exactly. Fearghas asks about the <strong>chains of Rovagug</strong>. If these guys had eyes, they'd narrow. \"What about the imprisoned god?\" Um… he hasn't broken free. Yet. That we know of.</p><p>Xurvanthrax lectures Shalkoc, \"this is what happens when you let slaves run free\". So we're Shalkoc's followers now it seems. \"What happened to the altar?!\" \"Oh this, it was like this when we got here!\" Fearghas says. Thankfully Emilio put down his brick. The altar was for <strong>blood sacrifices</strong> to open the door. Which of Shalkoc's followers should be bled out on the altar? Shalkoc is not a fan of the idea, we're good friends! He asks for the location of \"<strong>Imix' stash</strong>\", we are going there but first we need a lot of blood.</p><p>The telepathic bond ends, so no one is translating Draconic anymore. Shalkoc winks at me and steps onto the altar. Fearghas' response is \"Emilio? Duck!\" as he casts a <strong>Lightning Bolt</strong>. One of them casts <strong>Absorb Elements</strong>. Fearghas adds a <strong>Vicious Mockery</strong>, saying \"Dwarves are best.\" Dwarvenkind number one? Xurvanthrax against berates Shalkoc for letting his slaves run wild, and Shalkoc protests, you cannot call people slaves nowadays, I told you not to use the bad word. Kyrin takes out her crossbow and starts blasting, then ducks behind a sarcophagus to hide.</p><p>Sulythas roars a war cry so powerful we have to roll WIS saves. 3, 3, 2, 3… and a 16 for Shalkoc. Even after bonuses, he is the only one not <strong>frightened</strong>. Then Sulythas the Chieftain raises his axe and… that's a surge, blasting necrotic damage. Fearghas takes a greataxe to the face, gets knocked prone, then Shalkoc runs in and starts throwing hands. One legendary resistance later, no stun is happening. All good, Shalkoc punches the other guy straight back to sleep.</p><p>Emilio goes right into Void Form, though it's his last charge. Fearghas doubts the strategic value of this but Emilio says \"trust me\". Concern. He starts slicing with Reaping Claws, rolling a crit, and runs off a little way. I dodge a tail sweep attack of opportunity, and blast a 5th-level <strong>Lightning Bolt</strong> through Lioriel's staff. It fries Sulythas, reminding him he is dead. Fearghas follows through with <strong>Shocking Grasp</strong>, then <strong>Toll the Dead</strong>.</p><p>Kyrin shoots a bolt through Xurvanthrax' eye sockets, dropping him to the floorstones. Emilio in the background is casually snacking on essence shards to regain a <strong>Void Form</strong> charge and avail himself a few temp HP. Well that was easier than we thought… We start looting but there isn't much to be had in this room. Please tell me we won't have to bleed anyone on the altar… We go ahead and examine the metal gate on the left. They are magically sealed but we can see through the tiny holes in them. We consider teleporting through but decide to check the gate across the hallway first.</p><p>The other gate is similar, sealed but we can peer through. There is a passageway beyond the right gate but we have no idea where it leads. Fearghas is trying to find a way to break open the gates; summon an earth elemental? He can't see the hinges on the gates, welp. I offer to use my <strong>Shadowslip</strong> to scout, we agree it's a good idea, and I slip into a quivering puddle of darkness radiating anxious energy.</p><p>I ghost along the floorstones… and immediately stop. G-guys…? <strong>Dragon</strong> up ahead. I sneak along the wall. It's not a living dragon at least… a skeleton held up by metal fixtures, but these look far too small to hold the dragon bones. I assume it's undead and can move if it gets in the mood for it. In the same hall are more <strong>sarcophagi</strong>, richly decorated. I slink back and slip under the right gate, finding down the hallway a similar dragon skeleton… and a <strong>way out</strong>! We decide against looting the place, yes Fearghas I am ashamed of grave-robbing, I may have been adventuring for a while but I have not abandoned my principles thank you very much.</p><p>Shalkoc punches the gate, misses, oddly slippery this one. Fearghas and Emilio start blasting the gate with cantrips, and call Kyrin over to have a go at it with the <strong>Sun Blade</strong>. After a lot of loud whacking, the gate shatters, the sound bouncing between the walls. We hear cracking noises, and steps come stomping towards us! It's a <strong>Dragonbone Golem</strong>! I love the smell of initiative rolls in the evenings!</p><p>Fearghas casts Revelation Through Battle, but it doesn't seem to work on the golem, like it's resistant to magic? He drinks a <strong>Potion of Maximum Power</strong>. The Golem walks up, nearly steps on Kyrin without noticing her, gives Shalkoc a strange look and promptly starts beating up Fearghas. Kyrin whacks it with advantage, boom <strong>Sneak Attack</strong>! The Golem swipes at Shalkoc with such reach, I also need to dodge. Shalkoc evades, I take some damage.</p><p>I summon <strong>Fade</strong> and retreat, in great part because the Golem's fear aura is making me cry. Kyrin is also frightened, she retreats, hides, and shoots with her crossbow. Shalkoc steps up, rolls a nat 1 on the WIS save (sad trombone) and he is quaking in his boots. He proceeds to whack anyway, believing in Fearghas who believes in him. That doesn't work great as he is rolling with disadvantage, so he believes in himself a little bit too, and hits! \"Go to sleep go to sleep… please?\" He attempts a <strong>Stunning Strike</strong>, but the Golem pops a legendary resistance. <strong>Flurry of Blows</strong>! Miss. Another punch on top of it? Miss. Ah, well…</p><p>Emilio tries <strong>Eldritch Blast</strong>, two misses and a poor damage roll. Guys, Karnack says, we really need to <span><strong><span>ROLL BETTER</span></strong></span>. He's taking advantage of Domi's absence and the lack of stream to say it… He proceeds to fail the WIS save too, which only proves his point. <strong>Lightning Bolt</strong>, 3rd level, and the Golem fails the save! Fearghas Shields against one attack, Shalkoc dodges a Bite. Fade takes a nibble, and then… well cantrips won't work (ignore the earlier Eldritch Blast) because of the Golem's magic resistance, so I pull out my sling and fling a pebble into its eye.</p><p>Kyrin shows us how to do damage and pops up from behind the sarcophagus long enough to shoot it for big damage. Shalkoc finally passes the save, shifts to <strong>Mantis Style</strong>, and begins to put the Golem to sleep with his fists (unsuccessfully). He eats a surge causing him to <strong>permanently forget 2 languages</strong> he knows and replace them with 2 new ones. It can't ever be undone! Shalkoc only knows Common and Draconic! Kyrin decides to use a <strong>Martyr's Locket</strong> to take the curse off him, forgetting Undercommon and Elvish and learning Draconic and… Abyssal?!</p><p>Emilio is pissed off Eldritch Blast doesn't work, so he grows his claws with Void Form and starts reaping the essence shards… murdering the Golem on the spot. He immediately crunches on the shards to regain his Void Form. Fearghas mumbles \"Who's not dead, sound off.\" We all speak up, and he goes to check the body for <strong>alchemical components</strong>. Kyrin dips down the hallway to loot, I'm chilling with Emilio and Fade who's offering emotional support in the absence of my shadow.</p><p>Kyrin finds one flask of <strong>Oil of Immovability</strong> (essentially super glue) while Fearghas picks up <strong>Core Crystals</strong> and <strong>Essences of Legend</strong>. We talk shit IRL and proceed. As we round a corner, we find ourselves in a puzzle room! It has three exits, the one straight ahead leads to the dragon <strong>hoard</strong> we were teleported from, but we can't see into the left or right exit from here. Lava bubbles below, and many pillars rise out of it, each of them painted with a <strong>rune</strong>. Every rune is unique.</p><p>Fearghas runs his hand through his beard as he contemplates the room, searching for patterns. The two runes on either side of the door we came in through are glowing. Some pillars look like they've been <strong>dipped</strong> into lava more than others, like shiny worn keys on a keyboard. Fearghas gives Shalkoc a push to jump on the closest pillar; when he does, the rune lights up. He jumps onto another one… both pillars' symbols go out, and they start sinking into the lava, barely leaving Shalkoc enough time to jump to safety. The pillars resurface quickly, and Fearghas begins to instruct Shalkoc to jump to different pillars to try to identify a correct <strong>sequence</strong>.</p><p>We theorise a Fire Giant could touch 2 pillars at the same time while standing in lava. Fearghas and Shalkoc start experimenting standing on 2 pillars <strong>simultaneously</strong>. Nothing happens with 2 people on the same symbol. Shalkoc jumps to the right exit and sees through the gate… the room Kyrin described in her vision, with the lava pool and the <strong>chain</strong>! The left exit leads to a <strong>library</strong>. Fearghas' wizard senses are tingling…</p><p>We find a path to the hoard, using the power of symmetry! But we want to loot the place before going to the \"obvious boss room\". Using this logic, we quickly figure out the pattern to disable all the force fields blocking the doors. We make a beeline to the library and find a book in Draconic called <strong>The Birth of the Soul</strong>. It has fascinating information and theories about souls forming and interacting with Ley Lines.</p><p>We also find <strong>spell scrolls</strong>: Alarm, Find Familiar, Ashen Memories, Instant Siege Weapon (which Fearghas quickly grabs before Plex can reappear and get his hands on), Instant Fortification, Unseen Servant, and Word of Recall. Fearghas and Emilio split the scrolls between them, as they can transcribe them into their spellbook or <strong>Book of Shadows</strong>.</p><p>We proceed to the hoard. Doing our best to contain Shalkoc who is near-consumed by sheer greed, we investigate with Emilio's <strong>Detect Magic</strong>. The room is full of magic items of course, but the platform we initially came onto is magical, the one we are standing on right now (which is broken) is not. Touching nothing, we jump to the middle island and investigate the pillars. We suspect the pillars' magic is what teleported us earlier. They seem to be wards against intruders.</p><p>We think over it, and with the help of an Augury spell, decide to use a spellgem Fearghas gave me a long time ago; a 6th-level <strong>Mordenkainen's Private Sanctum</strong>. Protected by the spell, we vaccuum up the magic items and gold. As we divide items among us, Fearghas takes out <strong>Guardian Scales</strong> he's not using, so I get the Divination one and Emilio gets the Enchantment one. There is an item that only a Sorcerer can attune to; an <strong>Elemental Essence Shard (Air)</strong> that allows me to fly after using Metamagic. I'll have to give up my <strong>Belt of Dwarvenkind</strong> to use it though…</p><p>I give Fearghas gems I picked up, for spellscribing. Kyrin grabs the <strong>Elemental Gem, Red Corundum</strong>. Emilio picks up the <strong>Badger Hide</strong>, a set of magical armour. Fearghas picks up the <strong>Eyes of Minute Seeing</strong> and the <strong>Wardstone</strong>. Kyrin hops to the corpse of the Fire Giant she shot, and finds a <strong>Dragon Compass</strong> that will point to dragons. How incredibly convenient… She gives it a try, and it does not point towards Shalkoc! But it points that-a-way… oh that's the direction in which we saw the chain…</p><p>We only have so much time while Frengald is attacking the fortress, so we return to the rune puzzle room and go right, towards the room with the lava pool and the chain, the reason we came here, even! Fearghas puts up <strong>Leomund's Tiny Hut</strong>, and I use the <strong>Wand of Catnap</strong> to magically put Emilio, Kyrin, and Shalkoc to sleep for 10 minutes. Fearghas and me stay awake and keep watch. Shalkoc is not snoring, Kyrin does little snore-lets in between Emilio's… noises?! He's making conversation difficult. \"Torag's teeth, that boy,\" Fearghas grumbles. No wonder he needed a bubble to survive in the Void.</p><p>I peek through the entrance, and from the chain room I see… Fire filling the entire room, a face forming in the fire. Fearghas turns around and says that's probably <strong>Imix</strong>. It… it makes eye contact with us, right through the bubble. It shouldn't be able to do that?! Then it quietly returns to the chamber with the chain. Emilio snores himself awake, waking the other two. Fearghas talks to Emilio about his snoring. Then he talks about Imix.</p><p>We walk into the chain room. Just as Kyrin described it, a bridge of stone barely 5 feet over lava, with a pool in the middle, and at the end of it an altar over a circular pool, with the chain hanging in the lava. Kyrin's <strong>Dragon Compass</strong> is pointing straight ahead, but there is neither dragon nor elemental in sight. It's unbearably hot in this room. Emilio, Kyrin, and Fearghas drink their remaining <strong>Fire Resistance</strong> potions. A deep voice rumbles above our heads: \"So there are the thieves. Why are you taking so long?\" Fearghas asks the voice where it is hiding. Emilio calls it rude. Kyrin asks: \"Are you Imix?\"</p><p>\"That's what people call me,\" the voice responds. It accuses us… truthfully, really, of sneaking in and murdering its disciples. I telepathically prompt Fearghas to say we came for the <strong>chain</strong>. Imix is unimpressed, and says if we take the chain, the <strong>Frost Giants</strong> will slaughter them. Are… are we the baddies…? Imix says we could run back to <strong>Loki</strong> and leave his people alone. Fearghas says \"You're not the first dragon we met, Imix,\" and that Imix must have fled the Material Plane to escape <strong>Vrazzak</strong>'s grasp.</p><p>Fearghas offers Imix a peace-talk with <strong>Loki</strong>. Imix says although the Fire Giants revere him, he has no part in their war. He does have problems with people murdering his followers and stealing his treasure, though. At Kyrin's sassy prompting, Imix appears, a column of fire rising from the pit the chain hangs into. He says the chain has been a recent gift from the Fire Giant leader <strong>Narsund</strong>, whose god had acquired the chain. A quake shook the elemental planes when <strong>The Key to the World</strong> was shattered and woke <strong>Rovagug</strong> from his slumber, who in his rage managed to break a chunk of the chains. <strong>Surtr</strong> caught it, but Torag didn't trust Surtr's skill to reforge the chain to strengthen Rovagug's prison. Surtr was insulted and it came to a conflict between the two gods.</p><p>At this moment, the Frost Giants invaded <strong>Muspelheim</strong>, reigniting an ancient war. The Fire Giants prayed for Surtr's aid, who bestowed upon them Rovagug's chain. The Fire Giants' survival now hangs from this piece of chain. Imix says only Shalkoc should be speaking to him, and he has been silent. Shalkoc looks up from making <strong>smores</strong> over the lava. Imix asks him if a wild magic surge turned him green. \"Can you turn me back to <strong>black</strong>?!\" Shalkoc asks hopefully. Imix is confused because Shalkoc shows none of the traits of green dragons such as <strong>cunning or trickery</strong>. \"I would have taken you for a white dragon, for there seems to be nothing in you but hunger.\" Shalkoc is now similarly confused, standing here with his smores.</p><p>We somehow telepathically push Shalkoc forward to talk to the big guy. Ya can make more smores later, come on now, this is kind of about you mate. Shalkoc goes \"Now that you mention it…\" and begins talking about his <strong>dreams</strong>. Imix asks if Shalkoc even knows about the name he inherited; hasn't Vrazzak told him? Imix reveals Shalkoc is the heir of <strong>Nabu-Anshar</strong> and doesn't even know it. Imix, of <strong>Girra</strong>'s line (though Girra would deny it!), says <strong>Azag</strong> would be very amused to see Shalkoc. I yell out lore about the <strong>Dragon Aspects</strong> in the telepathic bond, and sense vague satisfaction from some kind of deity beyond the veil of reality. Should I maybe have been a Cleric of Knowledge…?</p><p>At Imix' urging, Shalkoc steps closer and sees his real form; a wingless red dragon. Fearghas wonders if Imix is a <strong>Drake</strong> instead of a true dragon. From Shalkoc's mind, we see Imix has a long <strong>serpentine</strong> body, and the fire only shrouds him. Of course, Shalkoc pisses off Imix by asking \"If you don't have <strong>wings</strong>, how can you fly?\" Imix taunts Shalkoc, \"How did YOU lose your wings?\" He is confused, doesn't think he was born with wings.</p><p>The Fire Giants are the first who ever treated Imix with respect, and they are the closest he has to family. He says Shalkoc doesn't even know his <strong>true form</strong>. Shalkoc says he was alone a lot, doesn't know his parents, his master died… Imix seems sad, then asks if Shalkoc has ever met someone else who can fly despite not being born with wings, or breathe fire despite not having fire glands. We say <strong>friendly</strong> words to Shalkoc, as his \"chosen family\". Shalkoc mentions <strong>Ivernia</strong>, which bamboozles Imix. Taking care of the spawn of another colour?!</p><p>\"Stop mocking me,\" Imix growls when Shalkoc says Imix is special for not having wings. Dragons who didn't fit their progenitor's image were <strong>culled</strong>. \"You ask me to reveal my form to you, when you hide in the shadows,\" Imix says when Kyrin asks. <s>Send nudes</s>. It sounds very wrong, but Kyrin reveals her true form as Imix consents to reveal his. She compliments him as a handsome dragon and asks permission to give him a gentle pat. \"Don't burn yourself,\" he growls. \"Sometimes, family sucks,\" she says. She does burn her hand.</p><p>I start towards Kyrin to offer help, but the massive dragon scares me… Imix taunts me for being afraid, so I plant my feet and cross my arms and defiantly claim <strong>I'm not afraid</strong>. Imix asks for Shalkoc's name, and he launches into a tirade that makes Fearghas facepalm with a loud clank. Somehow Emilio's patron is laughing. We also admit we swore an oath to Loki to break this siege, but for all that… we don't want to kill Imix. Then there is the matter of Rovagug's prison. We speak about the <strong>gods</strong> and their squabbles, but they are not likely to let Rovagug escape.</p><p>We ask Imix if he would let us return here, unharmed. He says of course, he never denied passage to <strong>pilgrims</strong>. We… saw evidence of this. I feel even worse about our intruding now… Shalkoc even offers to give the items we looted back, but Imix doesn't want them back, he only ever wanted <strong>peace</strong>. There is a teleportation circle at the end of the bridge, we can use it to come back here. Fearghas says we will talk with <strong>Loki</strong> about the conquest of Muspelheim, but warns Imix that Loki will want something in return. Imix does not care who rules over the Fire Giants; Narsund or Loki. Our oath is only to break the siege, and this can happen in a variety of ways.</p><p>We could try to resolve this war, by giving both sides a higher priority. If the gates were to be <strong>sealed</strong> again, this war would be over. Fearghas knows where the gates are, and how they work. They will be guarded, and closing them would break our alliance with the Frost Giants. Fearghas is starting to fear he might have to go give his god a stern talking-to and end his squabbling with Surtr. If Rovagug's chain was to be <strong>reforged</strong>, Surtr would have an immense incentive to <strong>end the war</strong> between giants, to protect his people.</p><p>Grumbling, Fearghas resolves to go to Torag and make him listen, which pleases Imix. Completely unrelated to all this, we speak about the <strong>Eye of Dahak</strong> driving the <strong>King of Lessia</strong> mad. Imix struggles to comprehend we, of all people, broke the <strong>Key to the World</strong>. Fearghas explains it was Aviana. \"What, the chicken and the snack?\" Imix laughs. \"Just the chicken, really,\" Fearghas says. Imix coils up for story time. Fearghas tells about Dahak tearing up <strong>Deadlight</strong> looking for Vrazzak. Later on, we found out Dahak had died, and much evidence pointing to Vrazzak being his murderer. Fearghas comes to the eye poisoning the mind of his king, and our inability to help.</p><p>Now the <strong>Matron of House Vandree</strong> made off into the <strong>Astral Sea</strong> with the <strong>Eye of Dahak</strong> and uh we don't know what to do. Imix says it must be Dahak's left eye, housing the spirit of Tiamat, and the only way to balance this is to expose the king to <strong>Bahamut</strong>'s influence from Dahak's right eye… likely in Vrazzak's keeping. The plot clumpens. (I've been writing this lore as we go and it's kind of incredible when I think of it. So much story! Wow! I even feel inspired somehow…)</p><p>Imix asks where in the Material Plane we are from. We say <strong>Erastrea</strong>, sort of, close enough for me really, still the Old World eh. Deadlight was in the New World, most of it still is, Shalkoc just happens to have a chunk of it which we now call Promise. When Imix mentions the <strong>Ashur Plateau</strong>, Kyrin asks about the <strong>Redwind Sands</strong> and what may be buried here. I recall lore we read in the tower in Jotunheim, and Imix says the Redwind Sands used to be a lush valley home to <strong>Yuan-Ti</strong>.</p><p>Kyrin's Dragon Compass can grant us safe passage with the Fire Giants. Imix asks for proof that Fearghas' claims are true. Aviana being in the <strong>Feywild</strong>, we decide to prove our claims with the means of a spell, <strong>Candle's Insight</strong>. I explain its effects and cast it, and Fearghas and Shalkoc speak again to Imix, with the flame remaining steady all the while. Imix tasks us with speaking to <strong>Torag</strong>, and then returning to him. I offer to return Imix' followers to life, but he laughs and say they would not want to return from a death earned in battle. I say we will then carry their honour with us.</p><p>Fearghas talks MAD shit about Kyrin to Imix, then tries to herd us out of here. She gives Imix the <strong>locket</strong> which captured her saving Shalkoc from his linguistically inclined surge. Fearghas contacts <strong>Frengald</strong> with a Sending, telling him to pull back his forces, the siege isn't breaking. Imix appreciates the present, and says a good conversation is also a treasure. He is becoming friends with Kyrin and I'm standing here with tears in my eyes this is so wholesome aaaaaaaa. Anyways.</p><p>Emilio asks about dragons in the <strong>Void</strong>. Imix says the Void corrupts any who look into it, and not everyone gets out of it with a mutually beneficial situation. Well eeeeeh Emilio's case is a bit more complicated than that, considering the absolute <em>state</em> of his village. Imix advises Shalkoc he can't run from what he is, from who his ancestor is. \"Try living like a green dragon more; you're on your way to discovering your true draconic nature, your true form. Look inwards, find out how green dragons work.\" This shows the path to Shalkoc's <strong>Mythic Dragon 3</strong>!</p><p>We say goodbye to Imix, and Kyrin's shadow gives him a little wave before we leave. Fearghas impatiently makes us all hold hands and casts <strong>Plane Shift</strong>, taking us all to Promise.</p>"

          "content": "<h3>Suspicious winking, Fearghas give me strength</h3>\n<p>Plex and Aviana argue about the best way to bathe in blood, disagree of course, and as Aviana chokes Plex they both teleport away. A normal Monday.</p>\n<p>Kyrin scouts the way to a room bursting with <strong>treasure</strong>. As we join her, Shalkoc's eyes nearly fall out of their sockets, but the moment we touch something we are yanked away and teleported to another room, where we promptly begin to fall towards lava. I do a little screaming, we fly and teleport to safety. Emilio breaks an altar with the power of a nat 1, Shalkoc licks one of the <strong>sarcophagi</strong>, tastes dusty. I say we should let the dead rest, so naturally Fearghas opens the sarcophagi and out come two skeleton boys.</p>\n<p>We have a chat in Draconic, the skeleton boys are confused and want Shalkoc to <strong>bleed one of his slaves</strong> (that's us) on the altar to open the doors. Shalkoc says slavery is bad, we sharply remind the skeletons they are dead. Shalkoc wanted to bleed himself on the altar while I heal him, and was trying to convey this in a wink. No. That's a no.</p>\n<p>Since we spilled no blood on the altar, the metal gates are <strong>closed</strong>. I offer to use my shadow magic to scout, as it allows me to slip under the gates. And… dragon. Just a skeleton? I'm convinced it's actually an undead. I find a way out and we decide to go for it, but the problem of how to open the door remains. Naturally we blast the door with extreme violence, waking the <strong>Dragonbone Golem</strong>.</p>\n<p>After a short fight and a linguistically inclined surge (ask Kyrin what languages she can speak now), Fearghas siphons alchemical components off the golem and we proceed to — gasp! — a <strong>puzzle room</strong>. With some trial and error and a lot of jumping, we find the answer thanks to the magic of symmetry and imagining Fire Giants splashing in the lava. The puzzle room has 3 exits leading to the obvious boss room, the dragon hoard, and a library.</p>\n<p>Fearghas herds us to the library where we find many <strong>spell scrolls</strong> and delicious lore in a book called <strong>The Birth of the Soul</strong>. We hop to the dragon hoard and loot the living daylight out of it, taking absolutely everything. A lot of money, rocks for spellscribing, and some magic items. One of them can only be used by a sorcerer, yoink. Emilio acquires the power of sniffing.</p>\n<p>Before entering the boss room, a divine voice advises us to rest. Fearghas and me exchange glances, we're not getting our spell slots back anyway? We realise everyone else is VERY out of resources and if we run into a big fight now without Plex and Aviana, we will certainly die. Fearghas puts up the bubble and I use the <strong>Wand of Catnap</strong> to put Kyrin, Emilio, and Shalkoc to sleep. We try to talk over the snoring, it does not go well. As our companions sleep, the boss checks in on us all casual-like, a column of flame capable of seeing into Leomund's Tiny Hut. T-that must be the fire god <strong>Imix</strong>.</p>\n<p>We saunter into the boss room. <strong>Rovagug's chain</strong> is right here! Then Imix appears and we start talking, very tensely because we just stole all of his stuff and murdered his people. Unsurprisingly, Imix is a dragon who cloaks himself in flame. Kyrin reveals her true form, and encourages Imix to do the same; we see he was born without wings and he tells us he was nearly killed because of it, as the dragon aspect cull their unwanted spawn.</p>\n<p>I talk everyone's brains off with <strong>lore</strong> in the telepathic link, making the DM happy. We speak about the <strong>dragon aspects</strong>, Imix speaks to Shalkoc as one dragon to another. Shalkoc hopefully asks if he can be turned back to black, with confuses Imix; he thought Shalkoc had gone from white to green, on account of him being so hungry.</p>\n<p>We talk with Imix for several hours, and he warms up (haha) to us, to the point he accidentally burns Kyrin's hand when she gives him a pat. She becomes best buds with the dragon, and we promise Imix to go <strong>speak with the gods (Surtr and Torag)</strong> so they stop squabbling among themselves and <strong>reforge</strong> the chains into Rovagug's prison. We hope this would encourage the Fire Giants' god Surtr to end the war with the Frost Giants, granting Imix the peace he so desires.</p>\n<p>A few closing words:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Imix referred to Aviana and Plex as \"<strong>the chicken and the snack</strong>\".

They wander into the library, to which Plex was granted access to before… except for one room. They get into the forbidden room, where Plex picks up a spell scroll of <strong>Ambling Abode</strong>. They also find a heavy tome with a large eye on the front cover. The eye opens tiredly and goes \"Oi! Get your dirty fingers off me!\" The book refuses to open until its wish is granted. The book has seen the world fade to grey before, and contains records from that time.</p><p>The book's wish is to see a play of \"<strong>The Fall of the Gith</strong>\" but played by an all-<strong>Flumph</strong> cast.</p><p>Plex agrees to fulfil the book's wish, and picks it up.

The goat-riding goblin <strong>Nailix</strong> is of Plex' tribe, and he used to bully Plex some time ago but he's mellowed out and is now a proficient goat-wrangler who performs in rodeos.</p><p>Plex promises to show Nailix a <strong>mountain goat</strong>. Nailix is not impressed, mountain goats are softies, don't you want a mount that is always trying to throw you off? He's got a point, Aviana says. Plex teleports Nailix on top of one of the satyrs, the goblin grabs his horns with expertise, the satyr tries to throw him off. Nailix is hanging on one-handed, holding his cow-boy hat in the other hand (goat-goblin hat?). Aviana captures the <strong>Elephant-Goat</strong> into the <strong>Iron Flask</strong>. She grabs the satyr Nailix is riding in one hand, Plex' neck in the other hand, and LEGS IT.</p><p>The hungry satyrs are too drunk to chase them. Nailix is having the time of his life; the satyr is not. Icky green booger-like things stick to Aviana's legs, which Plex recognises as the territorial markings of <strong>Snotlings</strong>; goblinoids who keep the frog-like <strong>Bagiennik</strong> as pets. Aviana is pissed off at the snot sticking to her feathers. She chokes Plex, who defends himself by saying \"Look where you're running!\". Wise advice under any circumstances, maybe not super helpful here. Aviana strangles Plex to within an inch of his life as he tries to scrape snot off of her for a late-night snack. As Plex is about to pass out, Aviana stops, causing Nailix to complain and request more running.</p><p>Aviana pours water over herself to try to wash off the snot, and tells Plex to teleport to Promise or something?! \"Oh yeah,\" Plex answers and licks Aviana's feathers to heal himself. She yanks open the <strong>transdimensional</strong> door somehow and they end up on Promise, Nailix looking extremely entertained as Plex is shaking him so he drops the satyr.</p><p>We teleport in to this exact scene: Aviana covered in green slime, trying to shake off a licky Plex, holding the horn of a satyr in the other arm. A goblin is holding the other horn of the satyr, both of these are very confused. Aviana questions the satyr in <strong>Sylvan</strong>, he is still very drunk and does not make sense. Fearghas casts <strong>Prestidigitation</strong> to get the slime off Aviana, to Plex' despair. Kyrin asks if Aviana tastes like chicken.</p><p>Emilio tries to <strong>intimidate</strong> Nailix, but he can't stop laughing by the power of a natural 1. \"Don't worry,\" the goblin says, \"it happens to a lot of my fans when they meet me!\" Emilio <strong>Eldritch Blasts</strong> the goblin, Plex launches Nailix 20 feet into the air, Aviana jumps in front of the goblin to protect him. Plex jumps with his rockets in front of the goblin to protect him from Aviana and her cursed Thunderfeet. Fearghas grumbles a <strong>Counterspell</strong> to stop Emilio's Eldritch Blast. Aviana lands, exploding from her boots (which hurts the satyr's head) but Plex falls down, somehow maintaining concentration on Telekinesis and holding Nailix in the air.</p><p>\"As much as I'd like to, you can't just kill people like that,\" Fearghas grumbles to Emilio. He reluctantly welcomes Nailix to Promise and invites him to join the <strong>goblins' quarters</strong>. Nailix wants to continue riding goats, Fearghas threatens to let Emilio kill him if he causes trouble, Aviana says \"but we have a goat right here\" and releases the <strong>Elephant-Goat</strong> from the flask. Fearghas asks why there is now a giant goat in the room. The goat locks eyes with Fearghas, who gets roasted by the Bag of Scolding as he pulls out the <strong>Wardstone</strong>. Yep, the goat is hostile. It charges at Fearghas, slams into his armour with a deafening clang, and the goat sags to the ground confused. It has never had a headbutting contest with a dwarf before…</p><p>Fearghas realises he has earned the respect of this goat, as it submits to his superior stability. \"Stay,\" he says to the goat. The goat stays. Fearghas prestidigitates a cold shower over the drunk satyr to sober him, and asks if he can get back to the Feywild. \"Do you get along with <strong>dryads</strong>?\" Kyrin asks. \"Yo dryads are the hottest shiiiieeet,\" the satyr says. Please please please we are not introducing him to Joline, she will MURDER him. Kyrin takes him to Joline, dragging him by the horns. Fearghas retreats to the cabin for a stiff drink, shouting \"Heel!\" to the Elephant-Goat.</p><p>Emilio and me follow Fearghas to the cabin, him because he got a spicy headache from this entire debacle, me to make sure Fearghas doesn't drink himself halfway to death. Kyrin is talking the satyr out of drinking, he is trying to hit on her and falling asleep. Then he begins to bellow \"songs\" in the forest, making all the birds flee. Joline is not happy to see the satyr (that's an understatement). She tells Kyrin about fast-fermenting fruit in the <strong>Feywild</strong>, which made the satyrs and the goblins best friends (on account of keeping them drunk). Her point: if the satyr is drunk enough, he'll get along with the goblins. Just do not let him, or any satyr, get sober.</p><p>\"What's a sober satyr like, then?\" Kyrin asks. \"Well alcohol has a reverse effect on satyrs, the drunker they are, the clearer their minds are,\" Joline explains. That… makes no sense, yet explains a lot. Kyrin takes the satyr to the goblin quarters; they've been busy brewing and are very happy to get a satyr friend. Kyrin gives them stern words of warning to <strong>leave the goats alone</strong> for the gods' sakes. The goblins are weirded out, then ask if this is about Nailix. Yes this is about Nailix. \"Baa means no,\" they say, and add they will need to talk to Plex.</p><p>The goblins request <strong>snot</strong> from Kyrin, as it is \"valuable and nourishing\". She goes very green so the goblin ask what she does with her boogers. Kyrin shows them how to shoot a snot rocket, and they are disappointed she lets them go to waste. The goblins dig for gold in demonstration that the further up you go, the better they taste! They have a conversation about <strong>beer, giants, and dragons</strong>. \"Dragons are cringe as fuck,\" the goblins claim and Kyrin leaps to her new friend's defence. \"Imix is hot!\" Goblins claim dragons all eat sweets, not people.</p><p>Kyrin casually says \"I have a castle we could drop the sponges on.\" The goblins are interested. She explains about the feodal lord's bully of a son <strong>Antoine</strong> from the Green Sea. We all meet in the cabin with the Elephant-Goat just outside, looking in through the window. Fearghas is avoiding the goat's gaze while draining his 5th tankard under my worried supervision. Kyrin is taunting him about the goat. Fearghas tells Plex and Aviana about <strong>Imix</strong> (while Plex is lighting a previously-eaten jade on fire). He explains our plan to talk to Torag and potentially Surtr so they will <strong>reforge Rovagug's chains</strong>, without breaking the party's oath to Loki to break the siege.</p><p>We discuss Mennon, Plex' boss. Aviana recounts their latest adventure in the Feywild just before they appeared back here. They mention <strong>Buttercup</strong> the Fey dragon, whom Plex assumes will help us talk to the <strong>Void dragon</strong>. Fearghas and Emilio lose their minds trying to explain to Plex that 1) the Void dragon is not his friend and 2) the Void dragon wants to kill him and likely all of us too. Kyrin asks if I can revive someone who has been eaten. I've never tried… and I would rather not find out, honestly.</p><p>Plex mentions talking to a door in Mennon's palace, then takes out his brand new sentient book. The eye looks around, then orders Plex to turn him around so he can see the rest of the place — not so fast I'm getting dizzy! The book is confused because we're not <strong>Flumphs</strong>. I explain about Flumphs, which I've seen before in the Underdark, hanging around <strong>Aboleth</strong> lairs. At Plex' asking, the book says it contains pictures made of crushed pixies. Oh dear… can't wait to find out this book is filled with stories like Aviana enjoys reading.</p><p>I ask Fearghas for some ale, it might help. He slides me a tankard. Cheers, friend. Kyrin says we can ask <strong>Claude</strong> in Heaven about the play. Plex suggests naming a lot of goblins \"Flumph\" so they can perform the play, as goblins breed rather quickly. \"Nonono don't tell your friends to start breeding immediately!!\" Fearghas yells at Plex (who spelled this particular adverb \"emidiatly\" and this needs to be documented). The book says it was written by a <strong>Gith</strong>. \"What's a Gith?\" Kyrin asks. The book explains, and Fearghas adds a <strong>Silent Image</strong> showing a Gith he's met before. \"They were assholes,\" he adds.</p><p>\"Have you seen how thick I am??\" The book asks, then tells Plex to put him down, all this moving is making it dizzy. Kyrin is asking the book some questions, offensive ones apparently. Or the book just has a foul temper. Plex is burning a 4th-level spell to make a bookshelf. Fearghas is phoning \"our boy in Heaven\" <strong>Ezeriel</strong> with <strong>Contact Other Plane</strong> to check on the weather so to speak, is it a good time, any hellish sieges going on? And does Heaven have Flumphs, Plex asks as he tries to drag in a tree. \"Leave the tree outside!\" Fearghas says. \"But I want to build a bookshelf,\" Plex says. \"Do that outside!\"</p><p>Plex concludes there are better bookshelves in Heaven and casts <strong>Planetrotting</strong>, teleporting us all and the sentient book to <strong>Threshold</strong>. Thankfully, the Elephant-Goat is not transported to Heaven. Miraculously, Plex is on target and we end up in the correct plane. While Plex is casting his spell, I ask Fearghas about the planar quake, the Key to the World, and Vrazzak. In this deathly serious conversation, Plex and Aviana begin yapping in Sylvan. Fearghas grumbles the spell <strong>Comprehend Languages</strong> and immediately regrets it.</p><p>We speak about <strong>Vrazzak</strong> and what he may do in his madness. Undeath is wrong and makes anyone mad… \"Hmm,\" Fearghas says. Aviana complains about having to hold hands with Plex while casting the spell, and wants to holds hands with Emilio.</p><p>I ask about the Giants' war and why the Frost Giants are invading. Fearghas explains he opened the gate as a part of a deal with Loki to free <strong>Aviana's tribe</strong> from servitude. Ah so this entire conflict… was caused by the party. Okay. Well the Giants wanted to throw hands long before the party got involved. We talk about Imix and the <strong>Dragon Aspects</strong>, Shalkoc falls down the stairs, Plex' spell finally goes off and we appear in Heaven!</p><p>We're taken to registration and Shalkoc is mulling over his conversation with Imix, wondering how to behave more like a green dragon. He has no idea how green dragons behave. Sometimes I forget Shalkoc can read and Plex cannot… Plex reminds us he got a wild magic surge that causes any door he walks through to slam shut and become locked. Oh no… We kindly ask Aviana to punt him through <strong>Heaven's Gate</strong> so he is not technically <em>walking</em> through.</p><p>Shalkoc does surprisingly well in the angel's questioning; his 5 bodyguards were already waiting outside and are disappointed but proud when he gets a <strong>level 3 guidance</strong>. \"They grow up so fast,\" they cry. Kyrin fist-bumps with <strong>Huey, Dewey, and Louie</strong> on the way. Fearghas asks about getting an audience with Torag about the chains of Rovagug, and we are directed to <strong>Shaik</strong>. We drop by the library on the way to ask Claude if he can research \"The Fall of Gith\" for us. He can, but it will take 18 days and should be done on Friday 4th of Duodecimus. Kyrin asks him for any lore on the <strong>Mistborne Isles</strong>, as she suspects Imix meant to mention that area of the world. Just before we teleported, he telepathically told her \"That reminds me of Rasa. I haven't seen him since he went into the mist—\".</p><p>We discuss what drugs each plane of existence is running on. Hell is definitely running on coffee and the Abyss on meth. Mechanus is on Adderall. Hades on antipsychotics. Nirvana on weed. Heaven is just sniffing incense. How in the world did we even get to this? Ah we glimpsed a book in the library… this is cannon now.</p><p>Leaving the library proves to be an issue, as the door is locked because of Plex. We eventually unlock the door and climb to <strong>Shaik</strong>'s office. She asks how we've been, says she is proud of us for dealing with the Hell issue. I'm getting tears in my eyes… Fearghas talks about the chains of Rovagug, and our need of an audience with Torag. She says she will speak to the <strong>Chalkost</strong>, Torag's honour guard. I ask Shaik if I could speak to Master Clementiel. She says all the healers are very busy, and she will let him know. I thank her, it means a lot to me.</p><p>We bid farewell to Shaik, and go fetch a pumpkin spice latte for Aviana because she is basic, then head to the Pilgrim's Path. We walk up the mountain and it gets colder, the path soon covered in a thin layer of snow. The path becomes a cobbled road and as we enter Torag's realm in <strong>Venya</strong>, the third layer, we receive the <strong>Forgefather's Blessing</strong>, the realm effect of this place.</p><p>Forgeheart is a beautiful place with holds carved into the mountains and snowy valleys. Fearghas sighs, \"It's beautiful.\" We feel inspired to do smithing work, except Aviana, her wisdom modifier is too low. The celestials here are living like dwarves, and the architecture is exactly the dwarven style Fearghas knows. He is very satisfied to have his certainty confirmed, Dwarvenkind number one. We meet one of the Chalkost, <strong>Bergi Ironfinger</strong>, who says she has received the message from Shaik. She asks whether we've forgotten the rules by which <strong>Forgeheart</strong> abides. Ummmm… Apparently we need an invitation from Torag himself, a forgehammer of pure oathgold called Torag's Toil. Striking the gate of the first forge with this hammer will open the gate.</p><p>A <strong>shrine</strong> to Torag consists of at least an anvil and a hammer. Upon receiving an invitation from Torag, the hammer on a dwarf's shrine will turn into gold. If we are seeking an audience though, we can be brought to the <strong>Forge of Visions</strong> where we may receive a vision of what our task is. This will be for Fearghas exclusively, as he is the only one of us who worships Torag. On his way there, Fearghas notices an absence of breweries and… alcohol in general really. He asks Bergi, who replies \"There is no indulgence here, the dwarves who would miss the taste of ale even in their afterlife would go to <strong>Elysium</strong> instead, where the god of brewing has his domain.\" Yeah, makes sense.</p><p>At the Forge of Visions, Fearghas is instructed to take a hammer, close his eyes, and start smithing. Despite not being a proficient smith, he falls into a trance. He wakes up to a <strong>scythe</strong> of blackened steel, nonmagical but covered in runes to contain evil, and words heard in his vision:</p><p><em>When madness grips the noble heart,</em></p><p><em>The flame of hope shall soon depart.</em></p><p><em>Into the east, where mountains mourn,</em></p><p><em>Where past in mist and shadow lorn.</em></p><p><em>Beneath the earth, in death it rests,</em></p><p><em>In ruined halls, on shattered crests.</em></p><p><em>Dear child of stone, to claim the hold,</em></p><p><em>Thou must wield wisdom, cursed and old.</em></p><p><em>Take heed and ward thy golden soul,</em></p><p><em>Lest thy dark might consume thee whole.</em></p><p>A very ominous weapon, unlike anything other worshippers have crafted here… I wonder how far east we should go? Bergi seems a little shaken as she returns with Fearghas. Plex is screaming the verbal component of <strong>Chain Lightning</strong>. I prepare to tackle him but he doesn't seem to be performing any somatic components. Emilio's eyes glow with power, I know that look, that's a Counterspell readied. Aviana innocently (?) asks if she would get kicked out of Heaven if she kicked someone into a mountain. Asking for a friend. Eye twitching, Fearghas glares at Plex. \"You don't know this spell, why are you screaming the words?\" Plex replies \"I know, can you teach me?\" Fearghas says, \"Absolutely not.\"</p><p>Fearghas shares his vision with us and assumes we should go to the <strong>Mountains of Mourning</strong>. Well that is certainly in the East… far in the East… Kyrin suggests asking Imix about it, so Fearghas again ritually casts <strong>Contact Other Plane</strong>, this time to contact Imix. He asks if he knows about any lairs of Vrazzak's in the Mountains of Mourning. Hm the signal with Muspelheim is not great… \"Aviana, hoist me up! Oh! I've got it!\" Imix doesn't know. Kyrin asks about the rest of the phrase Imix said to her when we got teleported away, but the spell doesn't allow for more than a few words.</p><p>I ask Fearghas to relay a question to Imix; \"Does \"the flame of hope\" mean anything to you?\" I'm half-expecting it to just be a metaphor, but Imix responds with \"<strong>platinum</strong>\". Well that's definitely unexpected… We can't take a long rest until Thursday so we have 3 days to kill. And there is the small matter of the <strong>full moon</strong> on Friday night, oh dear. We decide to return to Threshold to kick back, and hopefully I'll be able to speak to <strong>Master Clementiel</strong>.</p><p>We thank Bergi and walk back down the Pilgrim's Path while Plex is desperately trying to teleport his way out of taking a long walk. Plex messes up, find himself on the wrong side of Heaven's Gate and has to go through registration again. <strong>Verita</strong> asks him why he has to slam the doors so violently behind himself, this is no place for violence… Plex says he got a wild magic surge, and Verita arranges for someone to follow him around 24/7 and unlock doors that slam shut behind him with the means of a <strong>Silence</strong> and <strong>Knock</strong> spells. Along the Pilgrim's Path, we see beautiful crystalline flowers and some made of metal by the Chalkost. Kyrin politely asks if she may take one of each kind. She meets some confusion but receives permission and very happily picks two flowers.</p><p>We arrive in Threshold tired after our long walk, and find Plex in the baths with a pumpkin spice latte. He calls out a happy \"Hello!\" and I can feel Aviana's murderous urges. We discuss the prophecy Fearghas received and Kyrin suggests using the <strong>Sheeshah of Revelations</strong> to get more clues.</p><p>Master Clementiel messages me with a Sending spell, and I ask to meet up with him to talk about <strong>Lioriel</strong>. I ask whether his soul should not have returned to Heaven. Clementiel doesn't know why his brother's soul hasn't returned to Heaven; he trusts things are well, and it's not his place to question how these things work, souls don't necessarily return immediately or with their memories intact. I understand but… if Lioriel can be found, I'd like to try. Much as my guilt over causing his death is still very much alive, I want to help him if I can.</p><p>Fearghas offers to scry for Lioriel in Heaven and on the Material Plane; when we return to Promise I could also ask <strong>Kali</strong> to cast the spell for me. Fearghas takes out a crystal ball as a divination focus, and casts Scrying in Heaven, holding the <strong>feather</strong> I found after escaping the Sibriex lair. The spell fails.</p><p>We return to <strong>Promise</strong> via anchorchain the following day. Fearghas wants to scry on <strong>Dahak</strong> with the help of a Minor Illusion. The spell bounces off as if the target was protected from divination magic, but we can still deduce two things; Dahak is in the Material Plane in a state that is not death, and spells of 5th level or lower don't work on him.</p><p>Aviana wants to go hunt big game to feed Ivernia and Kaar. \"Shalkoc, park the island and we can drop down.\" Kyrin says we killed <strong>Griffons</strong> recently and still have their meat. Aviana and Shalkoc just want to go hunt for fun, and Plex is trying to contact Buttercup. Fearghas asks them to please kill the <strong>Flesh-eating Butterflies</strong> Plex brought from the Feywild. With a flex, Aviana requests a Potion of Giant Size from Fearghas. With the power of a nat 20 he crafts 3 potions and hands them all to Aviana.</p><p>Buttercup responds to Plex, \"There is nothing to talk about, leave me alone. I wouldn't want you to know where I am.\" I ask if Buttercup was always so… edgy? \"Nooooo, she was a little ball of happiness,\" Fearghas says. \"Very emotional,\" Aviana adds. Well that is concerning. Shalkoc suggests going fishing, turns out Emilio is pretty good at fishing but his methods are odds to anyone else; he jumps into the water, grows his claws, and skewers fish left right and centre. Works best on large fish.</p><p>Fearghas is spellscribing and gets teleported outside by a surge. Plex is jumping out the window and tries to bring the tree inside the house again. Fearghas forbids it. Non-negociable. He gets another surge causing him to lose proficiency in two skills and gain proficiency in two others. Much like the surge Kyrin took from Shalkoc, it can't be undone. Plex uses a <strong>Martyr's Locket</strong> to take the curse from him. \"Do I need Arcana proficiency?\" the goblin wizard asks himself. He loses Insight and Survival, gains Animal Handling and Stealth.</p><p>Kyrin looks lonely after we left Imix, so I give her a hug. Then we go bake heart-shaped chocolate cookies with Shalkoc, but his tend to look like butts instead. We have a little cookie party and hand them out to others.</p><p>I use a <strong>Sending</strong> scroll to contact my mum and ask what is happening on <strong>Ildilas</strong>, and whether her and dad are safe. I get no response… Panic? Panic. Some time and a cup of tea later, I go down to the forest and cast <strong>Speak with Animals</strong> as a ritual, taking my time to get it right. I kindly ask the spiders if I could speak to Kali if she has time. The spiders say since I'm not flying, and I'm not Kali's mate, she probably won't eat me. Thank you, spiders. I find Kali and ask her to cast <strong>Scrying</strong> on Lioriel for me, handing her the feather. The spell fails.</p><p>I have a very awkward conversation with Kali about spider and Drow mating habits. I… I saw… and heard… THINGS back in the <strong>Underdark</strong>, when I was travelling with the Matron's party. Some of the healing I had to do, all right… Whatever Kali does with her mate is none of my business and I'm happy for it to remain this way thank you very much.</p><p>Shalkoc, Aviana, and Emilio jump off the island for a spot of hunting. Emilio teleports to the ground with <strong>Void Torrent</strong> just before hitting, Aviana uses the <strong>Spirit of the Eagle</strong>, and Shalkoc unfolds his <strong>wings</strong>. Emilio eats a surge inflicting a permanent penalty to Strength checks. He was already a leaf in the wind, now he is an even thinner leaf in the wind. No big deal, whenever he gets a worse surge I'll cast Remove Curse on him and this surge will be washed off at the same time. Shalkoc hunted a sheep, Emilio murdered a herd of 5 horses on account of not being able to decide which one he wanted, and Aviana got one horse.</p><p>Neither Shalkoc nor Emilio are strong enough to carry any of these animal carcasses through the transdimensional rift. Plex follows them on a sponge, but before he jumps off the island he casts <strong>Death Ward</strong> on himself. \"Remember, you have exactly 0.2 seconds to grab the sponge and climb on! I'm landing at 07:45:03.\" — Plex</p><p>Plex is falling and screaming, but as he falls much faster than he screams, he slams down like lightning on the sponge, immediately shoots back up, and only then do the others hear his scream. Plex halves the weight of the sponge to fall faster, slams into the ground and shoots back up. Halfway to the island he realises he has no passengers. He shoots 2 miles past the island into the sky, rolls <strong>Animal Handling</strong> to see how well he can steer his sponge, natural 1. \"Naami, do you have the resources for Raise Dead? Revivify?\" Fearghas asks out of nowhere. Um… yes?</p><p>Plex falls down and shoots back up sideways, near parallel to the ground \"at mach fuck you\". He is a hypersonic missile streaking towards a lord's <strong>castle</strong> in the Green Sea. \"The goblin knows where he is by knowing where he isn't,\" says Karnack and we lose our minds. Emilio worries Plex might reach escape velocity. Plex is shooting towards a circular tower, he tries to aim for a window. Back on Promise we casually wonder how Plex, as a tailor, does not have a parachute yet. A goblin glider, if you will.</p><p>Plex threads the needle at mach fuck you, flies through the bedroom window of the castle where the lord is currently standing in front of a mirror and acknowledging his… excellent physique. \"Do I have time to cast a spell?\" Plex asks the DM. \"You have one action,\" Aerelia says. \"He's coming with me,\" Plex says and casts <strong>Vortex Warp</strong>, grabbing a naked French lord. Plex feels the added surface area of the nobleman, especially the flapping bits, are really creating more air drag and he is nearing the ground again.</p><p>Plex turns the sponge around so it faces the ground and as it slams down, it doubles its speed. Again. He fashions a ramp with his trusty <strong>Mold Earth</strong> but as he is bouncing and not gliding, he slams into it and bounces at an angle. He pops above the cloud, the French lord screaming behind him. He falls towards Promise now with the kidnapped noble. Fearghas randomly looks out the window then, sees a meteor falling towards the island, realises the meteor is 2 parts pinkish skin colour, 1 part green, and 1 part yellow from the sponge. Plex casts <strong>Feather Fall</strong> and gently touches down in the town.</p><p>Fearghas is dashing towards the town, I follow. The people of Promise cheer for Plex as he lands with the naked French lord. <s>Kyrin is extremely tired and reads Fucker Fell instead of Feather Fall</s>. After his crazy flight, Plex unlocks <strong>Mythic Trickster 3</strong>! Fearghas shouts at Plex and tells him to put the nobleman back where he came from, GENTLY. The lord is crying in French, no Fearghas I cannot translate it. Suddenly, Aviana's portal opens! Emilio and Shalkoc stumble through, followed by one dead sheep and six horse corpses, five of which showing clear signs of having been killed by Emilio.</p><p>Emilio glares at the naked lord, who to his credit does not die of sheer terror. Fearghas is telling Plex to let the Frenchman go, but Plex wants to take him to the goblins and grill him. Aviana steps through her portal, gets <strong>slingshot</strong> over the town, glides back and as she lands, flowers bloom at her feet. The explosion of her touching down fries the flowers and now everything smells like roses. Aviana is a Disney princess, confirmed. Plex is trying to sneak the crying man into the forest but Aviana hears the crying, grabs the man and flies him back down in the ruins of his town, destroyed by a shockwave left by Plex. Then she anchorchains back to Promise.</p><p>Fearghas is shaking and I greatly worry for his health once more, I better check on his blood pressure sneakily.</p>"

The undercurrents of the underworld speak highly of your... expertise, and it is this very skill that I require.</p><p>My cousin, Thelgem Grumblechest, met an untimely demise while on a critical diplomatic mission. His life was taken not by the scoundrels he sought to negotiate with, but by an outsider – an adventurer named Aviana. This harpy possesses abilities that border on the fantastical, growing to a colossal size and causing destruction with the ease of a child stomping on a sandcastle. Though the tales may be inflated, one cannot afford to be dismissive of even the slightest possibility. Thelgem was a mighty warrior and this accursed creature has to be to an awesome foe to have slain him.</p><p>Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to track down and eliminate Aviana. She currently resides on the island of Deadlight, in a cabin near the island's sole city, also named Deadlight. Discretion is paramount; while this is a matter of clan honour, it is imperative that the clan's involvement remains concealed as to not taint our diplomatic efforts in the region.</p><p>For your successful execution of this task, you will be compensated handsomely with 10,000 gold coins. Consider it not just a payment, but the settling of a grudge. The Grumblechests do not forget, and we do not forgive such transgressions lightly.</p><p>The terms are simple: Aviana's life in exchange for the reward. </p><p>I await word of your success.</p><p><strong>A Vengeful Benefactor</strong></p><hr><p>P.S. – To give you an edge, enclosed are the last known sketches of Aviana and a map of Deadlight. May they serve you well.</p>"

The implications of our involvement becoming known could severely damage the diplomatic relations between the Taldorian Empire and the nation of Deadlight.

          "content": "<p>As told by Farrow Windwhisper:</p><blockquote><p>Let me spin you a tale few outside the frozen halls of the frost giants know. This is a story passed down by my wife's people, whispered in the winds of glaciers and shared over roaring hearthfires. It is a tale of Utgard-Loki, the cunning king of the frost giants, and how he outwitted one of the most fearsome beings to ever walk this world: the lich Ul'katir.</p><p>Now, Ul'katir was no ordinary lich. His power was vast, and his knowledge of arcane secrets… well, it was said he knew more spells than there are stars in the sky. His greatest treasure was a grimoire, a book so filled with ancient and forbidden magic which he guarded jealously, letting no soul touch it. Except... except for the day he crossed paths with Utgard-Loki.</p><p>Utgard-Loki, as we all know, is no mere giant. He is a wizard of great renown, a trickster whose wit could cut sharper than any sword. He longed for that grimoire, not because he needed its spells—oh no!—but because he wished to prove that no one, not even a lich, could outmatch his cunning.</p><p>And so, Utgard-Loki approached Ul'katir with an offer. \"Mighty lich,\" he said, with a honeyed voice, \"I have heard tell of your grimoire, a tome filled with such power that even the gods might tremble. I would ask only to read it—once—so that I, too, might witness its greatness.\"</p><p>Now Ul'katir, ever wary, narrowed his glowing eyes. \"And what, pray, would you offer me in return for such a privilege?\"</p><p>Utgard-Loki smiled that sly smile of his, the one that made you think he already knew how the game would end. \"I will give you my most valuable tome. Surely, it will be a worthy trade.\"</p><p>The lich pondered this. A most valuable tome, you say? He thought to himself, \"What could the king of giants possess that rivals my power?\" But greed is a trap, and so Ul'katir agreed, though not without a safety net. He enchanted his grimoire, binding it with a spell that would return it to him the very moment Utgard-Loki read even a single word.</p><p>But Utgard-Loki… well, he is not one to play fair. He handed the lich his \"most valuable tome\"—and what was it? Not some ancient spellbook, not some arcane artifact. No, it was the teenage diary of Thor himself, which the trickster had stolen years before!</p><p>(At this, you might laugh, my friends, and you'd be right to! For this was the same Thor who, in his younger years, wrote poems of unrequited love, tales of his embarrassing misadventures, and dreams of one day growing a beard worthy of his hammer!)</p><p>Ul'katir, expecting some great magical work, opened it, only to be greeted by page upon page of Thor’s… rather juvenile musings. The lich, of course, was furious! But before he could act, Utgard-Loki was already gone, his prize grimoire in hand.</p><p>Now, what does our trickster do with this mighty tome? Does he read it? Does he unlock its secrets and claim its power for himself?</p><p>Nay! He takes it back to his hall, places it on his table, and uses it as a coaster for his drinking horn. Yes, my friends, the great grimoire of Ul'katir, the lich’s greatest treasure, became nothing more than a rest for a giant's mead!</p><p>Why, you ask? Because Utgard-Loki knew well the spell laid upon it. He knew the moment he read even a single word, it would vanish, returning to the lich. So instead, he let it sit beneath his horn, never once turning a page, and Ul'katir’s magic was powerless.</p><p>But that's not all! Oh no, the tale is not yet done. For you see, Utgard-Loki went a step further in his cleverness. He sought out Thor, yes, the very god whose diary he had given away. And with a whisper of false sympathy, he said to him:</p><p>\"Thor, my friend, I have terrible news. A foul lich by the name of Ul'katir has your private diary, and he reads it aloud to all who bring him treasures, gems, and scrolls. Tales of your beardless days, your youthful dreams of being a 'great poet'—he spreads it far and wide!\"</p><p>Thor, as you can imagine, flew into a rage like none had seen before. His thunder echoed across the realms, and with a flash of lightning, he set out to find Ul'katir and reclaim his diary. And Ul'katir, who had been so annoyed with his newfound 'tome,' found himself on the receiving end of the Thunder God's fury.</p><p>By the end of it, the lich had no grimoire, no diary, and a very sore skull from the wrath of Mjolnir.</p><p>And so, my friends, Utgard-Loki tricked not one, but two mighty beings. The lich, who thought himself clever, and Thor, who thought himself wronged by an innocent lich. All without ever casting a spell or lifting a weapon. Such was the cunning of the frost giant king.</p><p>And that, is the story of how the mighty Utgard-Loki made a coaster of a lich's greatest treasure, the grimoire which he proudly uses to this day.</p></blockquote>"

You’re probably muttering something about how this is all stupid and unnecessary, and honestly? I get it.</p><p>But before you start tearing apart the enchantments (because let’s be honest, I <em>know</em> you’ve thought about it), I need you to remember why you’ve put them up in the first place.</p><p>You’re a disaster sometimes. Not with magic—you’re good at that, obviously. But everything else? <em>Everything</em> else? You can barely keep it together. You forget to eat. You forget to sleep. You forget to take care of yourself like a normal person. And, yes, it’s embarrassing to admit, but it’s true.</p><p>I mean, look at the plants. How many have you killed so far? And don’t even get me started on the portal you left open a few months ago… What was it? An aboleth, a deva, a horned devil and a very confused goat? You can't keep letting things slide. This is supposed to make sure you stop acting like an incompetent idiot when it comes to the basics.</p><p>Here’s the deal. I enchanted the tower to <em>force</em> you to get your act together. Why? Because we both know you won’t do it unless you have no choice. You’re too good at avoiding it, making excuses, or getting caught up in something else. So, no more excuses. No more letting things pile up until it’s overwhelming. This time, you’re going to handle it.</p><p><strong>What you need to do before you can leave (and no, you can’t skip any of these):</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Take a bath.</strong> With soap! Not just splashing water on your face. (And <em>please </em>remember to put on clothes afterwards. No more accidents. We don’t need another embarrassing incident.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Eat a meal.</strong> A proper one. Not just some random snack. A <em>meal</em>. With veggies. And proteins. And no, potions don’t count as food.</p></li><li><p><strong>Water the plants.</strong> Yes, all of them. Especially the one in the study is practically <em>begging</em> for help. You’re the reason it looks like that.</p></li><li><p><strong>Close any portals you’ve opened.</strong> Seriously. You don’t want even more stray creature messing up the tower again. On that note, I still haven't found the dust devil that snuck through last week…</p></li><li><p><strong>Keep the tower tidy.</strong> All of it! I know, you hate it. But do it anyway. It’s about having a clear mind and a space where you can actually find things! Dust and clutter distract you, and you know it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Finish your experiments.</strong> No more half-finished nonsense blowing up in your face because you walked away for “just a minute.” Complete what you start or don’t start at all.</p></li><li><p><strong>Feed your prisoners.</strong> If you went through the effort of imprisoning someone, you should at least keep them alive along enough to get whatever information you wanted out of them. So <em>don’t forget about them</em> like last time. I sure hope I learned from that and you better not prove me wrong.</p></li><li><p><strong>Keep the artifact vault locked.</strong> If I have to thaw out the entire tower because you forgot to secure that artifact again, I swear I will scream.</p></li></ul><p>I know you’re going to hate this, but it’s necessary. If you want to stop feeling like a complete mess every time you finally come up for air, you need to fix these things. And yeah, I know part of you is reading this and thinking “but I’m too busy” or “I don’t have time for this,” but you <em>do</em> have time. You’re just choosing to ignore it. And that’s what got us here.</p><p>So suck it up, do the tasks, and maybe—<em>just maybe</em>—you’ll start feeling less like a walking disaster and more like… well, I don’t know. Someone who has their life together, at least a little.</p><p>Hopefully enchanting the tower and locking you inside will finally force yourself into actually being a functional adult. You're too powerful to be this messy and disorganized.</p><p>With love (and frustration), <em>Yourself</em></p><p>P.S. I swear if you undo the spell, I’ll re-cast it twice as strong.</p>"

          "content": "<blockquote><p>Azgaraz was a dwarven hold infamous for their 'acceptance' of magic and famous for being skilled monster hunters. Once upon a time their crown prince journeyed to Jotunheim with a large expedition to slay one of the legendary Jormungandr (Ice Wurms/Snakes) there.</p><p>While making camp, two of the dwarves went for a walk where they encountered a frost giant child. </p><p>The three talked and when the dwarves told the child that they were looking for a Jormungandr, the child told the dwarves of a place it had once seen one. It also told the dwarves story of a frost giant who once killed a Jormungandr, only to be slain by his own kin shortly afterwards and explained that Jormungandr were sacred to frost giants.</p><p>When the two dwarves headed back to their expedition, they were in two minds about the information they had just learned. One was exciting for having been told where they could find such a beast, while the other was concerned about the tale they'd been told and worried that a similar fate could await them.</p><p>When they returned, they spoke with the crown prince who didn't take the dwarf who voiced his concerns seriously, mocking him in front of the entire expedition and calling him a superstitious coward. The dwarves continued their journey and in the weeks it took them to find the place the child had told them about, the entire expedition treated the dwarf who had voiced his doubts with distain.</p><p>When the expedition reached the place, not far from Utgard, they found the Jormungandr and prepared for the fight. To add insult to injury, the crown prince forbade the doubting dwarf to take part in the upcoming battle, stating that a battlefield was no place for someone so soft.</p><p>When the battle began, the lone dwarf left behind at camp decided he had enough and went to Utgard to tell the frost giants about their expedition. The frost giants didn't believe him at first, after all why would anyone ever want to kill a Jormungandr, especially someone that short, and sent him away.</p><p>The dwarf returned to the camp and was surprised to see that his expedition had already won the battle and slain the mighty creature. When asked why he had abandoned his duty to guard the camp during the battle and where he had gone, the dwarf lied but it raised suspension anyways. </p><p>The expedition was celebrating their victory, feasting and drinking in a way only dwarves can, and so they didn't notice the small army of frost giants who had come from Utgard to investigate the dwarf's claims until it was far too late. When they arrived and saw the corpse of their sacred creature and the camp of celebrating dwarves, they went mad with rage and attacked. </p><p>Even though the dwarves were taken by surprise, they were all experienced veterans and put up a fierce fight. The crown prince, who had put two and two together, called the doubting dwarf a traitor and slew him before he, as the last dwarf standing, was slain by the frost giant's general soon after. With his dying breath he, in the name of all loyal dwarves under his command, swore revenge upon traitors and frost giants alike. </p><p>Thus only one dwarven soul came to be judged by Pharasma that day, as all but the traitor's still linger on that battlefield, bound by their crown prince's oath of revenge. </p></blockquote>"

Our ancestors worried for their kin but when the fools returned, our ancestors wept for they realised that they were kin no more. Their skin was burnt and blackened, and their eyes shone like smoldering embers, and when Torag saw this, he came and called them Duergar, and exiled them, for they were his children no longer. The Duergar pleaded for forgiveness but Torag knew their wrong was too great and when he denied them, the Duergar denouced him and crawled down into the deepest reaches of the Underdark, their hearts forever filled with hatred and spite.</p><h3>As told by the Duergar</h3><p>In the days of yore after our Father had chiseled the Dwarves from solid rock in his image, we all flourished under his tutelage.

We fled in terror back to our Father and brothers, yet upon our return, we were met not with warmth and succor, but with cold contempt and scorn. Confused we pleaded for our Father's forgiveness, but he betrayed us, renounced us, denied us as his children, and called us Duergar. For this is when we finally realised that our beloved Father views us not as children to be raised but as cattle to be kept under a yoke. And our former brothers stood by and watched, their eyes first showing the very look of superiority with which they still look down on us today, for they don't mind being nothing but obedient dogs as long as they get to sit next to our creator's feet.</p>"

          "content": "<p>The damp cold of Krasnograd was fertile soil for nightmares to grow in. Stanislav crawled into bed in his clothes while the fire glowed infuriatingly, its dying embers far from enough to provide warmth. He didn't need the feeble light. Even the cold wasn't the worst of it. But this damp, even when rain froze into snow ere it fell, the constant shroud of humidity that manifested in mist… <em>that</em> was maddening. It made the cold bite deeper, obscured sight, and generally made life miserable. Stanislav yearned to keep the fire burning through the night, but all the timber he could afford was pine. It would blaze bright and high, the resin crackling, and in minutes the fire would die down. There was plenty of pine to go around. Slow-burning oak, though, was a luxury reserved for the burghers and the aristocrats. Low folk like him slept in damp cold.</p>\n<p>Stanislav realised he was grinding his teeth. He stopped, knowing full well he would subconsciously begin again in a moment. He distracted himself by opening his mind to the darkness, within and without, and touched the fabric of magic. He brushed against the invisible strands, caressing them, savouring their presence. Responding to his will, a dark flame burst into existence just in front of his face. It produced no light, but he made it as warm as he could. The radiating heat dispelled some of the damp; Stanislav felt himself relax. The flame would endure after he drifted off, not very long, but enough for him to be fast asleep. Or so he hoped. He had used this trick in the past, and he'd woken up in the damp the minute the magic dissipated. He tried not to make it a habit, anyway. There was always danger to using magic, even a weak spell like this one. Lately, the damp had been unbearable. He lived in a shack, with more holes than solid wall. A good kick would tear the door right off its hinges. Tomorrow, this would begin to change. He would get paid; at least he hoped he would. Stanislav's thoughts began to unravel as the black flame lulled him to sleep. His final thought, heavy with spite, was that even a dreary shack was better than the house he had grown up in. He would choose being alone in the cold in a heartbeat, over spending another minute in Nikodim's house.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Iosif's face was lost in the shadows. He was a tall man but he walked with his shoulders slumped. He slouched when he sat, too. As if a blanket of wet wool was draped over his shoulders, that no one could see. Stanislav looked away from his father's face, and down to the uneven paving stones. His shoes were worn; a bit of woollen sock poked though at the toe. The cold was bitter today, the sky uncommonly clear. Iosif's hand rested heavy on the boy's head, making his skin erupt in gooseflesh. His heart raced, the blood beat in his legs. He crouched ever so slightly, ready to take off at a dead run.</p>\n<p>\"We aren't friends, Iosif. Why would I agree to this?\" </p>\n<p>A rough voice, in front of Stanislav. He peeked at the shoes of the man facing his father. Stout stained shoes, but free of holes.</p>\n<p>\"I've heard your wife gave you a daughter,\" Iosif slurred. \"Congratulations, and all. You'll need a man to work, though.\"</p>\n<p>\"And so you bring me your boy?\" Disapproval in Nikodim's voice, he was unconvinced.</p>\n<p>\"He's no boy of mine,\" Iosif spat. \"It's because of him… because of him, Nastasya is gone. I'm alone. Take him, and give me something to drink.\"</p>\n<p>The other man sighed. \"You'll regret that once you're sober.\"</p>\n<p>\"Never!\" Iosif barked. </p>\n<p>His hand formed a claw, his nails digging into Stanislav's scalp. The boy stood very still, his heart pounding in his throat. He could run. He could bolt and never see either of those men again. And where would he go? He was only seven. Who would feed him? Where would he sleep? He did have his tricks, but…</p>\n<p>\"Fine, I'll take him,\" Nikodim said. \"I could use an extra pair of hands, especially now Yegor caught the chills. I'll give you a crate for him.\"</p>\n<p>\"Two.\"</p>\n<p>\"One and a half and you'll get no more from me.\"</p>\n<p>\"Two, or you can teach your infant daughter to stir.\"</p>\n<p>\"You'll be the death of me, man. Two crates for the boy.\"</p>\n<p>They shook hands on it, and so Stanislav was sold to the brewer for two crates of beer. He never saw his father again.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Stanislav thrashed on his mouldy pallet, knowing in the dark depths of his heart the nightmare had only begun. He would have preferred to dream of monsters, of fangs and claws, of growls in the night. He would have given much to dream of hulking beasts stalking him for his lifeblood. Even dreams of the undead haunting this land and preying on people's minds would have been better. But he knew, as did anyone who didn't drown their wits in drink, that no wild beast of wayward spirit of Strazhland could ever be as monstrous as the land's own people.</p>\n<p>He was eight and a half, he thought. It didn't matter a lot; Yegor and Mikhail were still older than him. They were the brewer's apprentices who were learning the craft, helping Nikodim produce more drink and earn more coin to feed his wife and daughter. Stanislav was not an apprentice. The other boys were cold with him, following their master's example. They'd put sawdust in his bed, itchvine in his shirts, mud on his toothbrush. Maruska took pity on him sometimes, when she wasn't caring for baby Klara. The extra rolls of dark bread, given when nobody was looking; the thick new socks appearing in the chest at the foot of his bed; the errands he was sent on with a few coppers in hand and the hushed instruction to buy a piece of candy… they made it bearable.</p>\n<p>Stanislav had just returned from one of those, the taste of sugar still on his tongue. He carried a sack of dried hops, separated into smaller labelled bags. He hurriedly took off his shoes, his socks damp from the snow. He slipped into his hard clogs, ignoring the wet socks with all his might.</p>\n<p>\"What took you so long?\" Nikodim bellowed from the workshop.</p>\n<p>Stanislav ran over and offered the sack of hops to his master, who snatched it. He opened it and counted the bags, then glared at the boy.</p>\n<p>\"You didn't steal any, did you?\"</p>\n<p>\"No, master.\" What would he even do with those? They were dry and bitter… or so he guessed.</p>\n<p>Nikodim cuffed him over the ear. \"Don't speak so insolently and make yourself useful. Kettle three needs cleaning, mind that you give it a good scrub this time.\"</p>\n<p>Stanislav bowed his head and scurried away, clogs clacking on the tiles. He snatched a boar-bristle brush and a rough linen rag from the shelf, scooped up a handful of soap shavings from the box in a drawer, and grabbed a tin bucket. He dumped the soap flakes in, and went to the workshop pump to fill the bucket. He all but let himself hang from the heavy handle, jumping up and down to get the water flowing. Rag hanging from his belt, he threw the brush into the cold soapy water and lugged the bucket to the kettle. It had been lain on his side for cleaning, and was big enough for an adult to crawl into. Not that Nikodim ever would. Cleaning was Stanislav's work. The other boys cleaned too; there was plenty of scrubbing to do in a brewery. But the other boys also brewed, helped with recipes, and handled a variety of instruments which purpose Stanislav could only guess at. He only ever cleaned. Wooden barrels and vats, the bronze kettles, funnels and sieves, scales and pans, the long-handled spoons to stir the wort. And bottles, of course. Stanislav cleaned enough bottles to dream of them most nights.</p>\n<p>He crawled into the kettle, all the way to the bottom of it, and started scrubbing. The smell of bronze quickly mixed with the heavy, bittersweet smell of wort. His arms ached as he worked. Sweat stung his eyes. The air was immobile and stale and so, so damp. Crawling back out to rinse the brush was a treat. The taste of candy was all but forgotten now. Taking one last breath of drier, cooler air, Stanislav crawled back in. His shirt clung to his back. He wanted to be done with this so bad. His stomach growled. The work was not even half-done. If only he could speed this up. He was never fast enough for Nikodim anyway, never thorough enough. Every task had to be performed twice at least, with a cuff over the ear and a reprimand. What would it matter if he bungled it the first time? His ear burnt, blood beating in time with his frustration. He scrubbed with a vengeance, his thoughts racing. What if the opposite happened? What if he did it so well this time that even his tyrannical master could find no reason to punish him? What if…</p>\n<p>What if he used his tricks? </p>\n<p>Stanislav knew it was a bad idea, but he was just so tired. The heat in his ear made it difficult to think. His legs trembled. His arms were numb, the skin of his hands wrinkled. The smells of boiled grain, bitter hops, and metal twisted his stomach. Closing his eyes, Stanislav gave in to temptation. He reached out with his mind, touching <em>something</em> that was always here, his companion at night. His eyes went cold as if made of snow. He opened them to the dark bottom of the kettle. He saw clearly each bit of grain and froth clinging to the metal. A thrill raced through him as he used his trick. At his bidding, a patch of dirt vanished, leaving the metal shining and good as new. He would never have done so clean a job with the brush and rag! Exulting, Stanislav prepared to repeat the trick on another patch of the kettle. The job would be done in no time.</p>\n<p>A big hand grabbed him at the back of the neck and yanked him out. The fingers wrapped around his throat, making it painful to breathe. Stanislav found himself facing Nikodim, way too close. The brewer's face was red, his thick lips curled in disgust below a moustache like a giant slug. Stanislav's stomach lurched. The cold faded from his eyes, but he knew it was too late. He'd been caught.</p>\n<p>\"What did you just do?\" Nikodim asked, his voice terrifyingly quiet.</p>\n<p>\"Cleaning, master.\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't be clever with me. That was magic.\"</p>\n<p>Stanislav drew a painful breath and looked down. The brewer only tightened his grip.</p>\n<p>\"You used magic in my brewery, on my equipment.\"</p>\n<p>There was no use denying it. Stanislav nodded. If Nikodim just looked inside the kettle, he would see how clean it was! Surely that wasn't so bad? The brewer took a deep breath.</p>\n<p>\"Come along, boy.\"</p>\n<p>It was not a question; he dragged Stanislav by the neck. Through the workshop, through the shop in the front, outside the house. In silence, they crossed the street to the butcher's shop. They entered, Nikodim greeting the butcher with a gesture. No words were exchanged, and Stanislav didn't dare look up. He was dragged through the shop and into the room beyond. The smell of blood assaulted his senses. Nikodim twisted his grip, making him look up. The butcher's workshop was a small room with another door left ajar, offering a glimpse of buckets full of snow and carcasses hanging from the ceiling. Opposite the door, a long table was built into the wall, covered in scraps of meat. Above it hung a wide array of knives. The far side of the room, facing the door to the shop, was dominated by a heavy machine all gleaming dark metal. A ladder led up the back of it, to a large funnel. A gangly boy with a patch of scruff on his chin was standing at the bottom of the ladder, carrying a crate heaped with chunks of meat, streaked with white tendons and tough nerve. A small girl, maybe Stanislav's age, turned the handle on the machine. She pushed her entire body weight on it to make it swing down, then used the momentum to bring it back up. Her simple dress was dark, but the stains were nonetheless obvious. She was focused on her task and didn't look up. Maybe she was a little too focused. The older boy stepped away from the ladder, looking down.</p>\n<p>Nikodim stalked up to him and snatched a chunk of bloody meat from the crate. He dragged Stanislav up the ladder and pushed his head close to the funnel.</p>\n<p>\"Look,\" he grated. \"Look well.\"</p>\n<p>Pushing the boy's face closer, so close his nose nearly touched the iron teeth of the meat grinder, he dropped the chunk of meat into the funnel. The machine devoured it, metal gnashing against metal, crushing the meat between them. The tough flesh was squished and torn. A drop of blood splashed on Stanislav's cheek. The brewer dragged him down the ladder, past the little girl, to a metal tub the machine fed into. Coarsely ground meat dropped through the grate into the tub. Nikodim made Stanislav look across the room at the carcasses hanging among the buckets of snow.</p>\n<p>\"Does the meat in the bucket look anything like the animals?\" The brewer asked, his voice trembling with fury.</p>\n<p>\"No, master.\"</p>\n<p>\"Does it look like it was ever alive?\"</p>\n<p>\"No, master.\"</p>\n<p>Nikodim knelt in front of him, still holding his neck, face uncomfortably close.</p>\n<p>\"If you ever use that foul magic of yours in my workshop again, or in my house, or anywhere near me, I will put you in that grinder. The gods as my witness, it will be your meat through that grate, and your bones for glue. Do you understand me?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, master.\"</p>\n<p>\"Speak up!\"</p>\n<p>\"I understand, master.\"</p>\n<p>Nikodim released his grip then, shoving Stanislav. The boy stumbled and fell, his nose filled with the stink of blood and raw meat. He scrambled to his feet, his stomach clenched like a fist.</p>\n<p>\"You go back to the workshop now. And scrub that kettle. Properly. Any magic, and you know what happens.\"</p>\n<p>Stanislav ran.</p>\n<p>Nikodim made him scrub the kettle three times, late into the night. There was no dinner for him when he was done, not that he had wanted any. He was sick that night.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Stanislav woke with a start, his heart pounding out of his chest. The damp chill held him like vines wrapped around his limbs. He felt at his throat, gasping. His eyes were icy as he looked around the room. In the shard of mirror on his nightstand he saw they had turned black again, eyeballs as flooded with ink. He made them bend to his will, made them return to their usual grey. In the weak light of dawn he lay on his back, breathing, cursing the nightmare. He was not a child anymore. He had escaped. His past no longer existed, so why did it still torment him? Why would it not go away?</p>\n<p>He got up stiffly and tried smoothing the wrinkles from his clothes, to no avail. Grinding his teeth, he stripped off his shirt and cracked the thin layer of ice in his washbowl. The chill did him good, and he washed away the sweat from the nightmare. He pulled on a clean shirt and scrubbed his teeth. With luck, he could afford a good breakfast before going to his new job. Not one of those gritty, dense rolls made of boiled malts. He longed for white bread made of clean wheat, a treat that smelled nothing like beer wort. Stretching, Stanislav wrestled with himself for a short while, then gave in. He embraced the dark power within and conjured up a flame in mid-air, burning the humidity from the room. He filled the cramped space with the smell of baking bread and turnip stew. He warmed his hands around his black flame. He made blue sparks dance in the room, covered the walls in fanciful symbols, made a knife appear in his hand and then vanish. He conjured up illusory candy, revelling in the power flowing through his mind. As usual, letting the magic go was an ordeal. It was not foul. It was not shameful. It was part of him.</p>\n<p>He would not be a terrified little boy. If his past would not be buried, he would burn it with his magic, until not even ashes were left. He pulled on his coat and stalked out, locking the door with a wave of his hand. The smell of pastries wafted from up the street. He counted the coins in his purse and made up his mind. He would be paid tonight. Things would change. He bought as many treats as he could eat.</p>"

          "name": "02 - Grandma's Laundry",
          "section": "journal-pages",
          "content": "<p>Yanka kept to the shadows. She tiptoed through the dark streets of Krasnograd, the faint red of sunset leaving a faint reflection in windows. She longed to see a real sunset one day, untainted by the mists. Pushing her wishes from her mind, she focused on keeping her steps soft. The creaking of her wicker basket was loud in her ears; it could give her away. She tried to meld with the budding darkness, giving herself to its embrace. She reached the fountain unnoticed and set down her burden. She picked the spot farthest from the street light and, gritting her teeth against the icy water, began washing the dresses in her basket. There was not enough soap to go around, but was there ever? She worked methodically, her eyes picking out the stains in greyscale. No sensible person would be doing laundry at this hour, but Yanka did not have the luxury of being sensible.</p>\n<p>Whose dresses were those, now? Kostyusha's. She was frail and bent, and she had been telling Yanka about her daughter's family who went west, seeking their fortune near Gond's Hammer. The grandmother had shaken her head, eyes clouded. \"She said they would leave Strazhland. It's not so easy, leaving this place. The roads are dark. Much safer to stay and endure another winter. I hope she sees her folly and comes back.\" Maybe it was the folly of youth which possessed Yanka to have the same goal of leaving the region. In truth, she feared for her life if she was found. Her foggy memories indicated that much, at least. She was hiding in plain sight for now, just a face among thousands in the capital city. She just needed a little more time. Sighing, she turned her head towards the city wall, most of it obscured by a jumble of houses and shops. She could almost <em>sense</em> the forest beyond. Again, she had to fight the urge to abandon her task to climb the wall and look out over the Krasnyles. Guards would definitely spot her before she made it to the top of the fortifications. One glance at the Grove of Crimson Beauty, as much as she desired it, was not worth being noticed.</p>\n<p>One of granny's dresses was torn, Yanka saw. She would offer to mend it, for a price of course, though she doubted Kostyusha would accept. Her eyesight was still good, even if her legs didn't carry her so well. Her memory didn't seem to be failing, either. Not the best employer Yanka had found. Last month, she had cooked for a widowed man who had never got her name right. He had been a good catch, one of her easiest. Once she had found the coins in his mattress, she had simply slipped wolfsbane into his soup. Had the body been found yet? It certainly had been cold enough for the smell to delay in its appearance. She'd been fairly sure no one would miss him and even if they did, well his failing memory would explain it all. His tiny garden had been choked with wolfsbane, growing next to the aromatic plants. His valuables alone would buy her many supplies, but not here. She would not risk being seen here. No, she would first leave the city and travel to a smaller town or better yet, a village. She didn't need a lot, certainly. How difficult could it be to catch a few rabbits out in the woods? She trusted in her blood to guide her swiftly.</p>\n<p>Footsteps. Yanka fell into a crouch behind the fountain wall. Those were heavy steps, accompanied by the clanking of armour. Guards no doubt, though it didn't sound like many of them. A chill raced down her spine as she realised she had left her basket on top of the wide wall for anyone to see.</p>\n<p>\"Hello? Is anyone here?\" A male voice called.</p>\n<p>Yanka kept very quiet, her breathing slow and shallow. Her hand rested on the hilt of the dagger in her soft boot. The clanking came nearer.</p>\n<p>\"Show yourself!\" The guard called, drawing his sword.</p>\n<p>Yanka did nothing of the sort. There was no way he had spotted her. Was there? If only she hadn't left that blasted basket up there! The wind swirled, fluttering the hem of her ragged dress. It really was cold tonight. She hoped she would not catch her death, getting her hands wet in this weather. Her eyes watered as her nose started itching. She had time for an exasperated thought — Oh, come <em>on</em>! — before she started sneezing; once, twice, three times. They always came in threes. As quiet as her sneezes were, it was impossible three had gone unheard. She stood up, her hands raised. She could probably kill a guard if she got the drop on him; this was very much not the case. With a start, she saw how close the man was. A little more, and he would have stumbled on her.</p>\n<p>He was a grizzled human carrying a tiny lantern at his hip, ruining his night vision. Not that humans had much of that, she remembered. They were blind as birds after sunset. This particular bird carried a short sword and a buckler; as Yanka had guessed, he wore the uniform of the guard. Surprisingly, he was alone. Maybe he had just ended a shift and was on his way home? Just her luck.</p>\n<p>\"Why were you skulking around with your laundry?\" He asked.</p>\n<p>\"I wasn't skulking around. I was washing, and I slipped.\"</p>\n<p>\"Even so,\" he said, clearly unconvinced. \"Laundry at this hour? Surely you can't tell the stains from the clothes?\"</p>\n<p>She hesitated. She had her hood up as usual, the fur lining obscuring her face. Another one of her customers had bought her that cloak… not deliberately, but it had been his money all the same.</p>\n<p>\"I see well enough,\" she said. \"My mistress needs this done tonight, so if you would let me return to my task?\"</p>\n<p>He narrowed his eyes. \"Who is your mistress?\"</p>\n<p>\"Lady…\" She barely caught herself. \"Seleznyova.\"</p>\n<p>\"Doesn't sound much like a lady's name.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ah, every mother is a lady to one as young as me. I was raised properly in the respect of my elders.\"</p>\n<p>He stepped right in front of her. \"I have rarely heard a more obvious lie,\" he said softly.</p>\n<p>Caught unawares, Yanka looked up at him. He had a scar on his cheek, old and faded. Silver-streaked brown hair, cropped short, poked out from underneath his helmet. His scale mail was scuffed in several places, but clean. The leather straps at his shoulders shone, worn smooth with use. His dark eyes took in her features.</p>\n<p>\"Uncommon colouring, for an elf,\" he said. \"I imagine you are not from the city proper. Now why would one such as you lie about doing laundry at nightfall?\"</p>\n<p>\"I was really doing laundry,\" she stammered.</p>\n<p>\"For Lady Seleznyova?\" He prompted.</p>\n<p>\"For one old lady,\" she muttered.</p>\n<p>\"Give me one reason to think you just happened to be doing honest work and I should let you go free.\"</p>\n<p>\"I was doing honest work!\" For once. \"I was washing grandma Kostyusha's dresses, because she can't walk all that well herself.\"</p>\n<p>\"But why at night? Even if the darkness doesn't bother your eyes, the cold should deter you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Because…\" With a shock, Yanka realised she had revealed the name of her employer. Well, she didn't seem all that rich anyway. And she had the one daughter who might return. \"I need the money, sir. I spend the days working, but the pay is not enough.\"</p>\n<p>It was true, after a fashion. She had no reason to reveal <em>why</em> she needed the money.</p>\n<p>\"It's noble of you to help the elderly,\" he said. \"But not if it comes at the cost of your own family's well-being. At the barracks, we can always use extra hands. Clerks, healers… scouts. The pay is steady.\"</p>\n<p>His eyes never wavered. Yanka was sure he was being honest, but his gaze also seemed to pierce her to the soul. He had taken in her dark dress, her soft boots, the hood of her cloak obscuring her elven features, and he had added \"scouts\". He did not take her for a simple housewife, despite his assuming she was feeding a family. She guessed he wanted to keep an eye on her; after all, she was not making a very good display of innocence.</p>\n<p>\"It won't cost you to come and have a look around, at least,\" he insisted with a half-smile. \"The western barracks. Ask for Makar, that's my name. I'll show you around, explain the tasks you'd get. Now, I need to run, I'll be on duty soon.\"</p>\n<p>\"Maybe,\" she said noncommittally.</p>\n<p>He shrugged. \"The pay is decent. I'll see you soon, laundry lady.\"</p>\n<p>Makar smoothly sheathed his sword, turned sharply and loped into the night, armour clanking. <em>What was that all about,</em> Yanka thought as she fished out the sodden dress and resumed scrubbing. The cold seemed so much worse now, and her bones ached with a vengeance. Just one more, she told herself. She doubted Kostyusha could afford to pay her, but she'd feed her and give her a place to sleep. In the morning, Yanka would look for a new target. Working for the guard? Why would she ever do such a thing?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The next morning, Krasnograd was buried under a deep blanket of snow. Looking out the near-opaque window in Kostyusha's house, Yanka grimaced. The old lady had let her sleep in her daughter's room, small and sparsely furnished but warm and reasonably dry. Yanka crawled out of the heaped blankets and pulled on her clothes. A dark grey linen shirt went down to half her thighs. She stuffed it into her long stockings and laced them at the waist. Those were almost like breeches but made of fine-spun wool, soft and fleecy. They were bulky enough to hide the shape of her legs, but more importantly they kept her warm. She pulled her black dress over her head and pulled her shirt into place, then struggled with the buttons at the back. The dress was snug, unadorned except for a touch of embroidery at the neck, red thread in a garland of yew berries. It was coarse wool, and the cuffs itched. The skirts were narrow and divided. She had done the needlework herself and it was ugly, but who would inspect a seam <em>there</em>? She would be able to crouch, sprint, and ride without fearing to bare her good wool stockings to the freezing mists. That was, if she happened to come by a horse or some other mount. Not likely, but Yanka preferred to be prepared. </p>\n<p>Once decently dressed, she began the task of combing her hair. Her wavy locks reached to her shoulders, which was plenty long and already getting in her way. Ribbon and string didn't come cheap. Hair clips? She'd have to fashion them herself; their price was prohibitive, for someone with her plans. She worked her bone comb, one of her most prised possessions, through the heavy tangles and snarls. It was an exercise in patience. She contemplated cropping her hair short, then discarded the idea as she always did. Combing it every morning and night was meditative, a ritual of sorts. She needed to practice patience in all things if she was to escape the city and find her people out in the wilds. Yanka had no doubt she would succeed, eventually. Ancient blood flowed through her veins, the blood of wood elves who lived free, within nature. She would start in Volyansk. Well, she would start by <em>finding</em> Volyansk. She'd heard the name whispered enough to know it was a place of free people, far from the aristocrats' eyes. Yanka had many answers to find, and there would be none under the gazes of the highborn. A shiver raced down her spine at the thought of aristocracy; the mists in her memory roiled, resisting her efforts to dispel them.</p>\n<p>How her search for answers led her to the western barracks, she couldn't tell. Intuition? Fate? More questions? Any reason was good enough for her, really. She was not surprised to find Makar grinning at her as he put on his armour.</p>\n<p>\"Laundry lady!\" He called as she approached. \"Didn't expect you so soon, but you are quite welcome!\"</p>\n<p>\"My name's Yanka,\" she said, a little colder than she meant. \"I only came here to turn you down.\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't rush yourself so. Have you had breakfast?\"</p>\n<p>She'd eaten half a beer roll and left the cheese to the grandmother. Her stomach growled, which amused the guardsman.</p>\n<p>\"Off to the mess hall with you then, I'm pretty hungry myself.\"</p>\n<p>She let herself be lured by the promise of food. It was difficult to ignore Makar's good mood; it spread to the other guardsmen and the few guardswomen. For every person they met, he had a smile and a wave. He stopped sometimes to exchange a couple words and a clap on the shoulder with a fellow soldier. Yanka easily pictured Makar brightening up the place all on his own. When his voice boomed through a courtyard, the grey buildings seemed less dreary, the mist didn't cling as wetly.</p>\n<p>The mess hall was a long room with worn floors, worn tables, and worn benches. Guards shuffled to get their breakfast, most still half-asleep. At Makar's good morning call, they stood up straighter and squared their shoulders. It was systematic. Yanka fought an urge to giggle. She could not remember the last time she had <em>wanted</em> to giggle. Soon enough she was seated at the end of a crowded bench, balancing on half her bottom. Makar had obtained her a tray with a crusty roll of dark beer bread, a thin slice of cheese, a thinner slice of ham, and a bowl of thick soup. She was not sure of the ingredients, and didn't care. The soup filled her stomach with warmth that radiated into her limbs. Her toes were delightfully warm. She stacked the cheese on the ham, rolled them up, and dipped them into the soup. Soon, she was scraping the bottom of her bowl with the last of the bread. As usual, bits of sharp barley husk got lodged between her teeth. She fought to pry them free, then gave up. Such was life, when most bread was made with leftover malt. It was ground up to crush most of the husks, mixed with a little finer flour and eggs to make it all stick. The result was a dense loaf, often baked as fist-sized rolls, bitter with a well-hidden hint of sweetness, mushy and nutritious from the eggs. Cheap to produce thanks to the large quantity of by-product from the breweries, it was a staple throughout Strazhland. Low folk muttered the burghers' beer bread was ground to perfection without any sharp husks inside, and mixed with diced ham and cheese. It sounded delicious. Yanka sipped from the cup of strong tea she had received along with her meal. She could have used sugar, but that was a luxury. Well, bitter tea was worlds better than cold water. She'd have to get her hands on some leaves, before she left.</p>\n<p>\"You could be working with them, feeding us all,\" Makar said. \"Bet the soldiers would be awake and lively, just to see a pretty face like yours.\"</p>\n<p>Heat crept up Yanka's neck. It had nothing to do with the soup.</p>\n<p>\"Look, if you've only lured me here to hit on me…\"</p>\n<p>\"Lured you! I invited you here.\"</p>\n<p>She stared at her tray which was wiped clean, every crumb picked up and eaten.</p>\n<p>\"You'd be fed, here. I'm not trying to convince you, just please consider it. You look like you've been through hard times.\"</p>\n<p>\"Who hasn't?\" She said, repressing a shudder. Hard times? If she could only remember them! On impulse, she asked, \"I don't suppose you have a good healer? Not just a barber, mind. Someone who uses magic. For… my little sister.\"</p>\n<p>Makar's eyes grew grave. In the daylight Yanka saw their true colour, a warm brown like the bark of a towering oak.</p>\n<p>\"What ails your sister? Is her life in danger?\"</p>\n<p>\"Ah, no… but she can't seem to remember some things. Like fog in her mind, she says.\"</p>\n<p>The soldier frowned. \"I can ask Artyem if he has time to make a visit.\"</p>\n<p>\"I wouldn't want to impose,\" Yanka said hurriedly. \"But if I could speak with him on the matter? It might give me ideas.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hmm? Do you practice magic as well?\"</p>\n<p>Stone-cold goat shit, she cursed in her mind. Her lies would get her killed one day, the way she dug herself into a pit with them.</p>\n<p>\"Not really.\" That was just the truth. \"Lighting a candle is within my abilities, but no more.\"</p>\n<p>\"I see,\" he said. \"Well, a conversation can be had for free.\"</p>\n<p>She nodded, disliking the inquisitiveness in the man's eyes. He had it out for her, really! A scoundrel she may be, but to warrant such scrutiny from a stranger! <em>Be honest,</em> she admonished herself. <em>I'm not some street thug, I'm a criminal. The fact these people won't be missed doesn't make it any less murder.</em> Makar's eyes didn't seem so warm anymore. A lump formed in Yanka's throat. If he was onto her… She had to flee anyway, but she'd wanted to gather more supplies first, to prepare better. She didn't have a clue to finding Volyansk. Her blood would guide her to her people in the forests, wouldn't it? She would… she would know where to go! She would, right? That was how it went in stories.</p>\n<p>The tolling of bells interrupted her racing thoughts. Chimes blended in a deafening cacophony, each bronze call adding its own pitch, filling the air with vibrations.</p>\n<p>\"What's going on?\" She cried, her voice drowning in the noise.</p>\n<p>\"Attack on the gates. Stay here. Stay safe. I'll be back.\"</p>\n<p>And Makar was gone, rushing out with the other soldiers. Yanka was left alone, prey to her questions.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Makar had hoped for monsters. Wolves, bears, even the monstrosities that ate the former. Giant insects would have been good. Instead the \"threat\" was people, Strazhland's own people, a mob carrying the proverbial pitchforks and torches but also any and every rusty weapon and farming tool they could gather. A sea of farmers and craftsmen, youths and housewives, voices overlapping and yet joining in anger. Makar knew what they were screaming about. It was not the first time he witnessed such an \"attack\". It was not the first time he had to fight men who were like him. His heart seemed a stone left too long in the cold. The people only wanted warmth, safety, and food.</p>\n<p>\"We're not fighting our own people,\" he snapped at anyone who passed near him. \"Disarm them, restrain them if you must. Send them fleeing. If any of you does more than bruise them, he'll answer to me! They are our brothers and sisters!\"</p>\n<p>\"Makar, with due respect,\" a man said as he snatched a pike, \"those brothers and sisters are here for our blood.\"</p>\n<p>\"All the more reason,\" he grated. \"Break the cycle of hate. We can't talk tomorrow if we kill today.\"</p>\n<p>The young man sighed, and ran to join his unit. Makar strapped his buckler to his arm, and slid the long crook into the slot at the centre of the shield, where it clicked into place. The crook was good for turning blows and disarming opponents. He took a deep breath, memories of past battles flitting at the edge of his mind. Today… must not be a battle. Blood would be spilled, that was inevitable. But the more blood the people spilled onto their own land, the more bitter the defeat. Movement at the edge of his vision caught Makar's attention; it was one of the new recruits. He had heard the man's name in passing; Stanislav? Despite not being a soldier, he had been hired as a mage. He looked too young to fight, his sandy hair thin and messy. The youth clutched a crude staff with a piece of smoky quartz at the end, held by coppery wire. If nothing else, a good whack with the stone would hurt. The mage's cloak hung on his scrawny frame. For a heartbeat, Makar could have <em>sworn</em> the boy's eyes had turned black, but it was impossible. No man had eyes like that.</p>\n<p>The gates opened and the guards spilled out. Makar ran at the front, seizing strands of magic as he ran. He breathed in the magic, let it blossom within his lungs. He let it out on the next breath, shouting an incantation as he scattered a handful of sand from the pouch at his belt. His free hand moved through the motions of a familiar spell, a weapon much stronger than the sword, a weapon for avoiding battle. He saw everyone around him turn their heads away and he shielded his eyes with his buckler as he released the spell. The pale sunlight exploded in countless shards of every colour, dazzling, blinding. Makar's brothers-in-arms knew his tactics well, and they expected this spell. Very few were affected. The attackers, however… they cried and stumbled, their hands flying to their eyes. Not all of them, but a good amount. Those dropped their weapons and stopped in their tracks, their blood safe in their veins for now.</p>\n<p>Makar's chest filled with heat as words spilled out of him.\n\"<em>Your brothers' crimson rage, your cousins' spite</em>,\n<em>Let them be wind, make them the dust you tread!</em>\n<em>A father's anger swiftly fades from sight</em>;\n<em>No words can grow, where family has bled!\"</em></p>\n<p>His soldiers roared. They fought with the pommels of their swords and the butt of their spears; they swung lances like staves. They kicked and shoved, screaming wordlessly at the attackers. More than one peasant turned and ran. Many were bruised, some had the lights knocked out of them, but the majority of the defenders tried their best to not spill blood. Some of the tension left Makar; he blocked a blow with his shield and twisted his arm, catching a club — basically just a thick pine branch — with the crook. He stepped right into his opponent's space, their noses nearly touching.</p>\n<p>\"Go home!\" Makar shouted. \"You cannot help your family by dying here!\"</p>\n<p>The man screeched and turned tail, abandoning his improvised weapon. A branch. Makar tasted ashes. If farmers attacked the capital armed with branches, their trials must be dire indeed. Did the aristocracy spare no thought for the people growing their food? An explosion shook the earth to Makar's left. He spun, searching for its origin, and found it was none other than the scrawny mage. He had climbed on a flat-topped boulder and was waving his hands, sending dark energy streaking into the fray. One crackling bolt hit a woman with a pitchfork; she crumpled to the ground motionless. A death sentence — she would be trampled by the mob. Screaming his frustration, Makar knew he could not save her. Instead he dashed to the boulder, leapt up, and crashed into the young mage. They tumbled together in the sparse grass, the youth taking the brunt of the impact. He cried out and went limp. Shaking, Makar scrambled to his knees and checked for a pulse. The boy had just been knocked out. Not the solution he had hoped for, but it would do. There would be no more killing if Makar could help it.</p>\n<p>The skirmish was over in minutes. Limbs aching, one leg pulsing with pain from his fall, Makar retreated to the barracks. He made sure to keep an eye on that mage, choosing the words he would have with him once he woke up.</p>"

          "content": "<p>Erakho didn't mind bad smells anymore. You learnt not to, in this line of work. You learnt fast, or gave up faster. Erakho would not give up. These jobs, nobody wanted to do them, so he got paid well. The gold would grant his wishes; he would buy gifts for his mother. The work would grant his wishes; he would understand it all.</p>\n<p>He'd been sent to the harbour today, under a grey sky that seemed to weigh on the warehouses' peaked roofs. Small fishing boats huddled at the docks as if for warmth, jostled by a slate-coloured sea. The waves would get high and splash the docks, soon by the look of that sky. Erakho doubted anyone would be mad enough to set sail. The weather was never really good for it, when the waters were navigable at all. When winter was at its harshest, even the sea froze and none of the small crafts stood a chance against the sharp sheets of ice flung about by the ocean. As he worked and warmth spread through his limbs, Erakho thought about the mountains to the north. He dimly remembered a small village nestled in a hollow between tall hills with jagged slopes. He'd been too young then to seek meaning, but somehow the land itself had sought him. Even here, among cut stones and metal, the land whispered.</p>\n<p>\"Oi scrawny!\" A rough voice called behind him. \"Hurry it up, this storm won't wait for us!\"</p>\n<p>\"On it!\" Erakho shouted, out of habit.</p>\n<p>His daydream interrupted, he had to admit his co-worker was right; the weather was getting worse by the minute. Callused hands gripped the shovel and dug into the reeking pile of discarded fish skins and insides. He shovelled the guts, scales, and bones into his cart. The metal of his tool scraped against the uneven stones of the docks. He set the shovel in the hooks at the side of the cart and stepped between the shafts, grabbing the cart's handle. He threw his weight against it to get it rolling, then straightened his back. This would be a lot easier with ponies to pull, but then he wouldn't be paid as much. Racing the coming storm, Erakho rushed his reeking cargo into the warehouse alongside the other orcs.</p>\n<p>He wasn't an orc, not really. His co-workers reminded him often enough. <em>Half-blood</em>, they called him. His mother had explained why. He didn't care, so long as he got paid for his work. At the market, he had seen a lady selling shawls made of the wool of big rabbits. They were dyed fanciful colours, and though he hadn't dared touch them with his dirty hands, he was sure they would make a good present. Valya… his mother. She was the source of his courage. A pretty shawl was the least she should have. Erakho could not afford it yet, but he was setting money aside bit by bit. Tonight, though… maybe he could negotiate with one of the fishermen, for cleaning up after their work. How Valya would love a piece of fatty fish for dinner! As the rain started pouring down, Erakho decided he would try.</p>\n<p>He saw a large hand come just before it grabbed him. Zakhar the shift leader yanked him by the chain on his neck. The cold metal bit into Erakho's skin, numbing him to the shoulders. He hated when they did that. He endured for the money, for the sake of his wishes.</p>\n<p>\"What are you loitering about for?\" The tall orc growled at him. \"Get your cart emptied, and start filling bags. Good-for-nothing half-blood.\"</p>\n<p>The half-orc swallowed a snarl as his blood boiled. He bowed his head even as the chain pressed on his windpipe. Zakhar was bigger than him, and a lot heavier. Erakho had seen the corpses of animals who had tried to fight bigger ones; it never ended well. He was the small one here. Lay low, stay hidden. Zakhar shoved him with a scoff. Erakho hid a victorious grin; he was alive and well. He continued his work, filling coarse sacks with a stinking mixture of fish guts and straw, chopped small. They would hand it over to wagon drivers, who would see it delivered to farmers outside the city walls. Did the burghers know what made the turnips they dined on grow so round? Would they turn up their noses if they knew? He didn't let the amusing thought distract him, but it made the work feel lighter.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The knight was lost. Mist gathered around him, dyed crimson in the sunset light piercing through the clouds after the storm. Willows clad in the fiery hues of autumn lined the muddy road, silent guardians watching him struggle. His armour weighed him down, each step cost him more of his waning strength. How had he come to this road? He had been travelling alone a while, after losing his horse to wolves. The beasts were so hungry they attacked people… what savage land was this? Who cared for it? There was a road, muddy and neglected as it was. There must be people. He looked up at the sky, trying to make out the sun through the fog. Half the sky was ablaze with sunset, as if bathed with blood. An omen? He hoped not; he knew nothing of divination. If only his friend was with him…</p>\n<p>He shook his head and focused on walking. Wishes would not save him. Night would fall soon. Beasts were not the only danger; the cold and damp would further sap his strength. He had eaten the last of his food earlier, and his stomach growled. If he did not find a settlement soon, even just a farm, he would have to forage or hunt. With this suffocating mist, his chances were slim. He clenched his fists, clearing his head. He had fought all his life. He had been brought back from a place of no return. He would not die of exhaustion on a nameless road in the woods! Controlling his breathing and managing his strength, he walked on with iron determination. He would see the end of this road. His story would not end here.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Erakho walked home with a spring in his step. His hands and arms were cold from washing in icy water, but he had found some soap to scrub the stink off his skin. He brought a present for him and his mother, a thick slab of fresh, pink fish. It would make an excellent dinner, a reward for their hard work. As he reached the small yard at the back of their house, Erakho's ears picked up a familiar squeak. He crouched, taking a moment to call his magic, the land's magic, and drape it around his head. Just as he lay the spell on himself, threads of magic slipped from his grasp and snapped in chaotic patterns around him. He tried to regain control, but the primal force was entirely out of his grasp. His fingertips tingled, then stung. He looked down to see his nails growing at impossible speed to the length of claws, cracking and splintering. He sighed, then turned his attention back to the crack in the wall, from which his friend had called.</p>\n<p>\"Smula, are you here?\" He murmured, his voice coming out distorted to his ears.</p>\n<p>\"Always here,\" a tiny voice replied from the crack in the stone. \"Your hands?\"</p>\n<p>\"Wild magic surge,\" he said with a grimace.</p>\n<p>Emerging from the wall, the rat seemed to giggle at him. \"No one controls magic. You have food?\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course, my friend.\"</p>\n<p>With some difficulty, Erakho pulled dry bread and a small hunk of cheese from his pocket, and placed them in front of the small rodent. She happily got to work on the cheese, her pleased squeaks sounding like words of thanks mumbled around a mouthful of food. The half-orc waited for her to finish eating, then asked:</p>\n<p>\"What news while I was away? Is mum well?\"</p>\n<p>The rat brushed crumbs from her whiskers, and ate those up as well. \"As per our pact,\" she said solemnly, \"so do I watch over Valya. In exchange for tasty snacks. She went to the town walls today, returned late, picked up a stray.\"</p>\n<p>\"A stray?\"</p>\n<p>\"A human,\" Smula said. \"He did not look well. Valya had someone carry him into the house.\"</p>\n<p>\"When?\"</p>\n<p>\"Short time ago.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, my friend. Anything you'd like?\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't suppose that fish of yours still has the tail attached? You tall people throw out the best parts…\"</p>\n<p>\"Sure it has the tail,\" Erakho grinned. \"I asked for it just for you. I'll leave it out in a moment.\"</p>\n<p>The rat tapped her tiny paws in a happy dance, then scampered off. Straightening, Erakho tapped on the door with his unwieldy nails, and entered. The kitchen at the back was small but tidy, full of shelves stacked with labelled jars and pots. Valya had insisted Erakho learnt his letters and he has never been a fast reader, but he could make them out if he had to. He hated to write, the pen refusing to make letters as pretty as his mother's. Well, he supposed she had a lot more practice than he did, being a clerk.</p>\n<p>\"Mum?\" He called. \"Are you here?\"</p>\n<p>Valya appeared at the door, a small woman with wild silver-streaked red hair. She stumbled and grabbed hold of the doorframe. Erakho rushed to her side to support her but she was already straightening. Her legs had never been strong.</p>\n<p>\"Good, you're here,\" she said. \"Can you help? I've taken in a man, he collapsed close to the walls and the guards didn't have time for him.\"</p>\n<p>\"Your heart is too good,\" Erakho growled. \"What if he's a bandit?\"</p>\n<p>\"He's not. What happened to your hands?\"</p>\n<p>\"Wild magic.\"</p>\n<p>\"So it is,\" she shrugged. \"Come with me, now.\"</p>\n<p>Grumbling, the half-orc put down his wrapped-up fish and offered his arm to his mother. She leaned on him gratefully as she urged him to the other room, which was in great part occupied by a long table, half of it cluttered with writing implements, candles, and clothes awaiting mending. On one of the wide pine benches, his face lit by a sputtering candle, lay a man clad in armour. He didn't look a bandit, not with the battered breastplate and the heavy saddlebags next to the bench. A lost traveller, or a mercenary.</p>\n<p>\"Tell me what happened,\" Erakho said as he knelt by the stranger.</p>\n<p>\"The guards were just bringing him in. But there was a skirmish earlier, and their healers were busy. They were going to leave him in a corner until they could spare time for him. He is not from here.\"</p>\n<p>\"He certainly looks like an outsider,\" he said, examining the pale blond hair and fair skin. \"Does he bear symbols?\"</p>\n<p>\"He carried a shield, but it's too damaged to make out the design for sure.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hmmm. He doesn't seem injured, but help me remove his armour. Though first… I need to trim these nails.\"</p>\n<p>After a short battle with the clippers, they struggled with the armour straps, Erakho holding the unconscious man while Valya slipped off the heavy breastplate. No wounds below, yet he barely breathed. Erakho pressed his hand to the man's cheek. His skin was much too cold.</p>\n<p>\"He was out too long, I imagine. He can borrow my bed until he comes to, and I'll sleep on the floor if necessary. We have enough blankets.\"</p>\n<p>\"But he'll live?\" She asked anxiously.</p>\n<p>\"If he warms up and we feed him, I don't see why he wouldn't. But he is very weak. Whatever possessed him to travel these roads alone…\"</p>\n<p>\"We can ask him when he wakes,\" she said. \"Did you bring something for dinner? We still have potatoes and a little bit of kale.\"</p>\n<p>\"I brought fish,\" Erakho beamed.</p>\n<p>\"Fish! What a good boy you are. I'll set it to baking, and make broth with the bones.\"</p>\n<p>\"Just don't throw away the tail,\" he warned as he lifted the man and carried him up the narrow stairs.</p>\n<p>\"Of course not!\" Valya called from the kitchen.</p>\n<p>They had a sumptuous dinner that evening, not just the mother and the son but also the little rat outside, along with her many siblings. Valya kept a rich broth simmering in the pot above the fire, with instructions for Erakho to feed some to the stranger if he woke. She shuffled to her bed shortly after dinner, leaving her sewing for another day. Erakho stayed longer, heating up some water so it wouldn't be stone cold, as he washed in the small copper tub. He didn't dare burn enough wood to heat up all the water, just one pot's worth of it to dilute the cold. He scrubbed the sweat and the stink from his light green skin, and washed his short black hair. The tub was too small for him to sit in, but it was fine to stand in. It was luxury to even have a tub, but Valya was paid well and so was he. It was not a rich life, but they were safe in Krasnograd, and life was good enough as long as they were together. That night, Erakho made himself a pallet in his room and slept on the floor, keeping his ears sharp in case the man woke, but he didn't stir until dawn.</p>"

          "content": "<p>Osten carried a body in his arms. It was small and much too light, like that of a child. The person he was carrying stirred and struggled, though weakly. He was not entirely sure she'd been awake just a minute ago. There were two other men walking to either side of him, one a dwarf, the other a human. With this, Osten remembered. These people were his companions, his friends. He blinked, and the space around him became a familiar town, sturdy buildings surrounded on all sides by colourful stalls and tents. Crossroads of the plains, the heart of the Diamond, the merchant town of Yarinn blossomed around him.</p>\n<p>\"Osten, please let me down. I can walk, really.\"</p>\n<p>The halfling's voice was tiny, a whisper he doubted the others had heard.</p>\n<p>\"Not a chance,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"I assure you, I am quite fine! This is embarrassing now…\"</p>\n<p>\"Pretend you are a princess who lost a shoe,\" he joked, but she didn't smile.</p>\n<p>\"She speaks!\" The dwarf muttered with a glare. \"Naami, you are an idiot. This magic will kill you.\"</p>\n<p>\"I know my limits, Magnus.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh you do? That's why you saw fit to burn your very life away? Don't deny. I saw it. You know it too.\"</p>\n<p>\"It was necessary,\" she said with that stubborn set to her mouth.</p>\n<p>The dwarf sighed. \"Maybe. But to my eyes… you are a candle burning too bright, too fast.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm… really better at controlling it. Osten, if you'd just let me down, please.\"</p>\n<p>He looked down at her. Some colour had returned to her cheeks, and her voice was stronger. He hesitated, but crouched and gently lowered her to the ground, letting her stand on her own. True to her words, she could walk, if somewhat slower than usual. It cost her; her face was set in a frown, and her shoulders had a stiffness to them. She was fighting through her fatigue, but he had to admit she was right. Before, when she used that magic, she had lost consciousness. It hadn't happened this time, though it was a near thing. She recovered faster than she had.</p>\n<p>\"I wish you'd explain it to me,\" the other human said, pulling his flamboyant purple cloak tighter around his shoulders.</p>\n<p>Naami smiled. \"I've tried, Daman. It's not something I can teach.\"</p>\n<p>\"If I visited the place you come from, maybe,\" he continued, but his eyes were distant as if set on a place even farther away.</p>\n<p>His eyes had been wrong, ever since the visions. Months had passed, but the wizard was no longer the same. He'd stare into space and mutter to himself, and he had done those things before but always with grand gestures, picking words from his sentences and shouting them for effect. He had done it for an audience, though he might not admit it. His musings had turned sombre, his face often overcast with an emotion akin to dread. He refused to speak of his vision any further, and Naami could not find anything wrong with his body. Whatever he had seen that day, it had altered his mind.</p>\n<p>Without thinking of it, Osten slowed to fall into step with Naami. She put on such a brave face. He hoped the baker was still in town, the one who sold the poppyseed and lemon cakes. And he would get some mead for Magnus, to appease his grumbling. For Daman, well… short of ancient secrets and promises of long-lost power, he didn't know what could still please the man. As he thought along these lines, the wizard muttered some kind of excuse and drifted away to a stall stocked with books and arcane components. This really was getting —</p>\n<p>He stood alone in a dark place. Shadows shifted around him and his bones ached with intense cold, yet he couldn't see his breath in front of his face. He had forgotten something important, and try as he might, he could not bring to mind so much as a clue to it. Within his chest was a pull, a yearning, the wish to answer a call. Desire to prove himself, to reveal who he really was. He tried to move but his body was sluggish, as if severed from the mind. The sound of rushing water came ever closer. He had no sensation of moving, no sensation whatsoever, but the noise… He was drawn near, by a power surpassing all he had ever known, to the river.</p>\n<p>Naami called his name, and the dream shattered.</p>\n<p>Osten woke with a start, gasping for breath. His body was so heavy. It wasn't so cold here, though it was damp. He welcomed the humidity, welcomed the ache in his limbs and the gnawing emptiness in his stomach. He was weary and famished, but he was alive. Where was he? He'd been walking through a burning forest. No… it had been autumn leaves, their colours so vivid against the mist. He couldn't remember finding people but he was definitely lying in a bed, inside a house. Through thick windows almost more bubbles than glass, he glimpsed the grey light of dawn. By the wall, a shape stirred and rose from a pile of blankets. Osten held his breath, numb fingers feeling for weapons and finding none.</p>\n<p>\"So, you are alive after all,\" a deep voice said, the words still heavy with sleep.</p>\n<p>\"Where… am I?\" The words barely came out; his throat seemed to splinter and crack inside.</p>\n<p>\"Safe. Mum picked you up and brought you here. Stay in bed. I'll be right back.\"</p>\n<p>The man stretched and lumbered to the door. He wore loose trousers and his chest was bare; black hair made a strange contrast on his green skin. He was tall even by Osten's standards, with a prominent jaw and a bulky build. An orc? Osten's thoughts were slow, his mind refusing to work. He nearly slipped into slumber again, but the delicious smell of fish and herbs reached him and he was wide awake. His host returned with a wooden bowl and spoon.</p>\n<p>\"You're probably hungry but take it slow, we don't want you getting sick. Think you can sit up?\"</p>\n<p>By sheer force of will, Osten forced his exhausted body into a sitting position, then leaned on the wall behind him. He was fully dressed, but even so the wall felt cold. As he reached out to accept the bowl, his hands were shaking so much he would certainly drop it. He tried to make them steady. His head spun. The feeble light seemed to glow and shimmer. A callused hand felt his forehead, radiating warmth.</p>\n<p>\"Aren't you in a sorry state. Mum will cry her eyes out if you die, so drink up. Slowly.\"</p>\n<p>The smooth wood of the spoon touched his lips, and savoury fish broth trickled into his mouth. Osten drank greedily, though his host only let him have small sips. The hunger pangs grew worse but the room came back into focus, the light growing steadier. New warmth spread throughout his body. His hands still shook but they weren't as heavy.</p>\n<p>\"You're really lucky, you know. Your strength was almost spent. If mum had found you any later, it might have taken magic to bring you back.\"</p>\n<p>Deep unease sent shivers running down Osten's spine. He did his best to ignore them, but the chill lingered.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you,\" he managed.</p>\n<p>\"No need. I'm Erakho. It was my mum, Valya, who had you carried here. Mind your manners around her.\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course. I'm Osten.\"</p>\n<p>Erakho raised an eyebrow. \"Not from here, are you?\"</p>\n<p>\"Where…\" He had to clear his throat. \"Where is <em>here</em>?\"</p>\n<p>\"Krasnograd.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm… not familiar.\"</p>\n<p>Erakho set the empty bowl down on the small nightstand. \"This is the capital city, man.\"</p>\n<p>\"Which country is this?\"</p>\n<p>\"Strazhland. How did you even get here?\"</p>\n<p>Osten sighed as memories came flooding back. \"I'm not sure why I returned to the Old World. It's folly to be here. I was on my own, something beckoned me far away. I chose to go east, at random. I was riding for months, and some days ago my horse was killed by wolves. Poor Moonstone, she was a good steed. She saved my life by throwing me off. Bought me time. Is there no one maintaining your roads? I walked through mud without seeing a soul.\"</p>\n<p>\"You must have walked the old Krasnyles road. No one comes through here anymore.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's putting it mildly.\"</p>\n<p>Erakho shrugged. \"This land is old. Places wither and die, others emerge. It's only natural.\"</p>\n<p>He opened a closet that decidedly leaned to one side, retrieved a shirt and pulled it over his head. Yawning, he fumbled with the laces, gave up, and shrugged into a sleeveless tunic of dark green wool. Just then, the door opened and a small woman limped into the room. Valya, Osten assumed. He tried a small seated bow, with debatable success. She gave a start and rushed over to him.</p>\n<p>\"You're awake!\" She exclaimed. \"Are you well? I see my boy fed you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, thank you.\"</p>\n<p>\"You looked near death last night. We're not wealthy, but we'll help you get back on your feet. I have to go out after noon but I'll stay here a while, if you need anything.\"</p>\n<p>Osten nodded, though his head was growing fuzzy.</p>\n<p>\"He might need more sleep,\" Erakho warned. \"I doubt you're getting a story out of him today.\"</p>\n<p>\"One can hope,\" she said with a sheepish grin. \"I'll be downstairs, you need some breakfast.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thanks mum!\"</p>\n<p>She called something in response, but Osten didn't catch it. His eyes would not stay open. Erakho was at his side, supporting him as he lay back down. The pillow was thin but so comfortable, a cloud beckoning him. Sleep was a mire lying in wait for his unwary steps.</p>\n<p>\"Get some rest,\" he said in a surprisingly gentle voice.</p>\n<p>\"Wait,\" Osten called, words spilling from him. \"Can you… chase away the nightmares? Ward my dreams?\"</p>\n<p>A smile. \"My magic doesn't really work this way. But I'll ask my friend to watch over you. Don't be afraid of the rats in this house. We have a deal.\"</p>\n<p>Osten blinked. A deal with the rats? Was he already dreaming? But he felt so warm. Nightmares were always cold with the chill of death, now. He doubted his god would listen to one such as him, but he offered a prayer. A prayer for warmth in his dreams, and memories of happier days.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>\"You want to go to the guardhouse <em>now</em>?\" Erakho said incredulously. \"It's dark!\"</p>\n<p>\"It's usually dark here, it seems,\" Osten mumbled around a mouthful of beans. \"And they kept my weapons.\"</p>\n<p>They were all seated at the table, the end which wasn't too cluttered. Osten was trying to hold back but he found himself devouring the simple fare; dark beans boiled with fish broth until mushy, roasted turnips with herbs, and a basket full of crusty rolls of coarse bread. Did people not shell their grain here? He spat a sharp piece of barley into his hand, trying to be stealthy about it, but neither of his hosts seemed to care. There was goat butter with the bread, and a little bit of sliced ham carefully divided among the three of them.</p>\n<p>\"Of course they kept your weapons. You're an outsider.\"</p>\n<p>\"I need them back so I can ply my trade.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're a mercenary then?\" The half-orc asked.</p>\n<p>\"I… was a soldier. But now, I'll fight where I'm needed. I must pay you back, for taking care of me.\"</p>\n<p>Valya, who had been eating in silence, drew herself up. She was still much smaller than the men at the table, but her stern expression made up for the lack of height.</p>\n<p>\"You would be insulting us,\" she said in a frosty tone.</p>\n<p>\"But… You saved my life.\"</p>\n<p>\"And I don't want money for it.\" Her tone softened. \"I didn't take you into our home in hopes for payment. I did it because life… all life… is precious.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mum…\" Erakho began, but she motioned for him to wait.</p>\n<p>\"My son has long since learnt this lesson,\" she said proudly. \"This land is cold and merciless, but for every evil, there is good to be found. Often hidden, like the cabbages who sleep under the snow, but it is here if you know to look for it. I choose to do good. For years, I have chosen to break the cycle of evil. I don't ask that you do the same, but respect my choice. I do not want payment from you.\"</p>\n<p>Across the table, the big half-orc sniffed and scrubbed at his eyes before taking keen interest in his turnips. Osten felt a tug deep inside his chest. Valya's eyes shone with resolve. Such strength of will… he bowed his head.</p>\n<p>\"Forgive me,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"There is nothing to forgive. Your intentions were good.\"</p>\n<p>\"They remain so,\" the knight said. \"Would you accept a present, at least? For no reason other than I wish you to have it.\"</p>\n<p>She hesitated, but nodded. When the meal was consumed and nothing but crumbs remained, which Erakho carefully collected and took outside, Osten searched his pack and pulled out a square of blue silk folded around a small pendant. The silver chain had some dark stains despite his precautions, but the pendant itself was as beautiful as ever. He thought it was garnet, cut and polished in the shape of a heart and delicately set in silver. He gave it to Valya, along with the silk.</p>\n<p>\"If you want it, it is yours. I think it would suit you.\"</p>\n<p>She held the pendant to the light of a standing lamp, watching reflections dance within the stone. \"It's beautiful,\" she whispered.</p>\n<p>\"Mum, wait,\" Erakho said just as he returned. \"Let me have a look.\"</p>\n<p>He held the pendant reverently and closed his eyes, a look of concentration on his face. The air seemed to shift. Magic? The half-orc had mentioned magic, in the morning. So he could work spells. Not for the first time, Osten wished he had the gift of magic as well. He had suspected the pendant to be magical, but had no way of knowing for certain.</p>\n<p>\"It does have magic!\" The man exclaimed. \"Faint, but it seems safe from what I can tell. It's steady, don't think it will cause surges. Some kind of protection.\"</p>\n<p>\"That is too valuable for me to accept…\"</p>\n<p>\"Please,\" Osten said. \"I hadn't known it was magical. The colour will compliment your hair.\"</p>\n<p>She chuckled and put on the necklace, holding the pendant to her heart. Her eyes widened as she let out a long sigh and leaned against a wall.</p>\n<p>\"They're not aching as much,\" she said. \"My legs. Is it the magic?\"</p>\n<p>\"Might be,\" Erakho said, \"though I'm not entirely sure. It could be another type of magic altogether.\"</p>\n<p>\"Another magic?\"</p>\n<p>\"Your magic, mum.\" He pulled her into a hug.</p>\n<p>Osten busied himself with the dirty dishes, bringing them to the kitchen and placing them in the stone sink. He went outside and cracked the ice in the rain barrel, which conveniently doubled as a snow barrel, and drew a small bucket of water. He set the plug in the sink, poured the water, dropped in a shaving of soap, and set to work with the brush. He took his time, letting himself get absorbed in the simple task. When he had washed and dried the bowls and cutlery, he swept the small stone counter and placed the neatly stacked dishes on top. He found a broom leaning in a corner and gave the floor a sweep as well, pushing the dust out into the backyard. His work done, Osten stretched in the tiny yard, feeling strength return to his body after the hearty meal. The cleaning had helped too, loosening the stiffness in his muscles. He was still weak, but his knees no longer threatened to buckle under him. Could he handle himself in a fight? Not yet. Hopefully he would not have to.</p>\n<p>A knock on the door announced Erakho's presence. He filled the doorway, his heavy build framed by the light from within. The half-orc cleared his throat.</p>\n<p>\"Thanks for giving us space here. And the help is really appreciated.\"</p>\n<p>\"No problem. You've still helped me more than I've helped you.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're… not trying to settle debts?\" Erakho asked.</p>\n<p>\"No. I'm just doing what feels right.\"</p>\n<p>The half-orc nodded with a small smile. Instead of beckoning Osten in, he stepped out and shrugged into a patched cloak. He handed Osten his own cloak of heavy wool, dark blue and threadbare in places.</p>\n<p>\"The guards won't be asleep yet,\" he said. \"It's just a short walk away. Think you can manage it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Sure,\" Osten said. \"And… thank you.\"</p>\n<p>Erakho waved his hand as if to dismiss the formal gratitude and they set out down the dark street, ice crunching under their boots. The earlier rain had drenched every street and every stone; by morning it would all be frozen in a smooth, deadly mirror. With luck, snow would fall and cover the ice but if not, these people had better have grips for their shoes. He had used some, a lifetime ago, when he was still growing into his boots. Straps of leather fitted with low-grade iron nubs could be tied on any shoe, and greatly lessen the risk of slipping. It was a good solution for poorer folk or children, who could not afford a pair of winter boots with sturdy iron grips built into the soles. Even a lifetime of living in the cold did not make you immune to a bad fall.</p>\n<p>Osten put on a brave face, but by the time they reached the guardhouse his exhaustion had returned. He was drenched in sweat and breathing hard, and it took a lot of his willpower to not lean on the wall as Erakho knocked at the brass-banded pine door. A man in uniform opened but before he could say anything Osten caught a strong voice from inside, reprimanding another by the sound of it.</p>\n<p>\"… out of your mind? I gave clear orders!\"</p>\n<p>A mumble answered.</p>\n<p>\"I don't give a goat's arse that you're not a soldier. There are orders, you obey them. For everyone's <em>safety</em>.\"</p>\n<p>The guard at the door looked like he very much wanted to trade places with the door, maybe even the stone it was set into.</p>\n<p>\"Are we… coming at a bad time?\" Erakho asked.</p>\n<p>\"You could say that,\" the man said. \"New recruit making trouble.\"</p>\n<p>\"We don't want to add to the trouble,\" Osten said. \"I was found unconscious close to the gates yesterday. I just want my sword and shield back.\"</p>\n<p>Inside, the stern voice quieted. It was subtle, but Osten saw Erakho relax.</p>\n<p>\"Errm, you'll have to speak with the lieutenant about that. Regulations. I think he's done now so why don't you come in? We're on duty, so no beer, but we can spare two cups of tea.\"</p>\n<p>\"That'd be lovely.\"</p>\n<p>They were led into the small guardhouse, a circular room on the ground floor of one of the city wall's towers. A fire roared and popped, bright yellow flames devouring resinous pine logs. A squat man with greying brown hair motioned for them to sit at the table, and stepped to the other guard for a word. Osten was not trying to eavesdrop, but the lieutenant's voice carried. In a room this small, it was impossible not to overhear.</p>\n<p>\"Keep an eye on Stanislav. I don't want to be rid of a mage so soon, but his actions yesterday concern me.\"</p>\n<p>The guard nodded, saluted, and left the room, leaving the older man alone with Osten and Erakho. He spread his hands in welcome, his voice booming in the confined space.</p>\n<p>\"Good evening, gentlemen. Let me get you a warm drink, then we can talk.\"</p>\n<p>Within minutes, they were all cradling a steaming mug of tea. There was nothing to add to the tea, and when Osten tried the beverage he nearly spat it out. It was so bitter, his tongue wanted to curl in on itself. Erakho nodded appreciatively and took a long swallow.</p>\n<p>\"So, what brings you here at this time of night? I'm Makar Semyonovich, lieutenant of this happy little band.\"</p>\n<p>Erakho nodded to Osten, nudging him to speak. He introduced himself as he had at the door, adding his first name only, and asked for permission to retrieve his weapons. Makar raised a bushy eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\"So it was you,\" he said. \"I wanted to keep you here, but with the cough going through the barracks this week, our remaining healers are overwhelmed. Good thing Valya took you in, then. I'm glad to see you back on your feet. What brings you to Krasnograd?\"</p>\n<p>\"I was lost, really. I was told I ended up on an old road which nobody travels anymore.\"</p>\n<p>\"Aye, truly unfortunate. What were you doing on that road anyway?\"</p>\n<p>\"Looking for a settlement, a farm, anything. Wolves killed my horse.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wolves.\" His dark eyes did not move from Osten's face as he gulped his tea.</p>\n<p>\"I was shocked they'd attack travellers on a road, even one as ill-maintained.\"</p>\n<p>\"And where did you come from, on that horse?\"</p>\n<p>\"From Lessia.\"</p>\n<p>\"On your own?\"</p>\n<p>\"I've been travelling alone for some months,\" Osten said, beginning to feel uncomfortable under the scrutiny.</p>\n<p>\"Do you not know our roads are dangerous to unwary travellers?\"</p>\n<p>\"I did not. I'd never been this far east.\"</p>\n<p>\"So what brought you this far?\"</p>\n<p>Osten shrugged. \"Curiosity? An urge to see what's over the next hill.\"</p>\n<p>\"What are you running from?\" Makar asked in the same tone he'd used for every previous question.</p>\n<p>\"The cold,\" Osten answered without thinking.</p>\n<p>Makar's eyes narrowed, and Osten knew he had fallen into a trap. His throat went dry; he hurriedly took a long drink of tea and regretted it. Years of practice kept his face composed.</p>\n<p>\"This is not a good place to be running from the cold, son.\"</p>\n<p>\"I've realised as much.\"</p>\n<p>\"So I ask again. What are you running from?\"</p>\n<p>Osten shifted his feet, keeping a tight rein on the memories threatening to overwhelm his mind. \"I'd rather not have this conversation with a man I've just met. With all due respect.\"</p>\n<p>Makar leaned forward, his voice dropping to a whisper. \"You are a guest in this land,\" he said. \"A rude guest who does not share his last name, but a guest nonetheless. Now this rude guest only asks for his weapons back, offering nothing in exchange. I'm responsible for these people's safety. What am I to make of you? Tell me why I should let you walk through our city with so much as a bread knife, Osten.\"</p>\n<p>Uncomfortable silence. Erakho was running his finger along the edge of the table, his head tilted to one side as if listening for something the others couldn't hear. Makar's eyes flickered to him, then back. The odd behaviour wasn't helping him look innocent, Osten realised. And, he admitted with a sigh, Makar was right.</p>\n<p>\"I've been an adventurer for years,\" he said reluctantly. \"I'd rather not speak of my life before that. My father tried to have me killed. There is no place I call home anymore. Maybe that's why I'm travelling, maybe I'm running from my past. I was with three friends, but we fought a rime worm. One… one of us fell. We disbanded our party. I picked a direction of the compass at random, and set out thinking maybe I'd meet new companions.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's a story,\" Makar said.</p>\n<p>\"Just answering your questions.\" His throat was tight. He blamed the tea.</p>\n<p>\"I imagine I got more than I bargained for, but I see you understand why I have to ask.\"</p>\n<p>Osten nodded. He wished there was water to drink. Even close to that blaze, he felt… cold. Deep inside. His breath caught as his heart raced. No, stay calm. He had a chance to prove himself less suspicious, and he must not ruin it with nerves. He needed his shield back. There could be other swords. A spear or a mace would do. But his shield…</p>\n<p><em>Pure force crashed on him, slamming down on his shield. He dropped to his knees from the sheer weight of the blow. His arm splintered in a thousand shards of pain. A scream was torn from his chest, pulled from his throat. He'd felt the bones snap. For the sake of those behind him, he'd held the line. Not a step given, not an inch lost. Sickly blue light, and black spearpoints. Overwhelming… cold.</em></p>\n<p>He hauled his mind back to the present, pushing his hands flat against the tabletop to hide their trembling. He made himself speak, to keep his throat from closing. He put strength into his voice, firmness, confidence. <em>As a Defender I will stand solid as the walls…</em> No. He was not worthy of that pledge.</p>\n<p>\"My shield is worth much to me. With it I protected dear friends. Please, if you must keep my sword, at least return my shield to me.\"</p>\n<p>\"What would you do with just a shield?\"</p>\n<p><em>Defend.</em> \"Protect.\"</p>\n<p>Makar let out a long sigh. \"I don't suppose you're looking for work… <em>and</em> can follow orders?\"</p>\n<p>\"I could consider it, but I take it you are really spread thin if you're offering work to outsiders.\"</p>\n<p>The older man grimaced. \"Better an outsider who follows orders than a local who fires on peasants. But we need mages. This one particularly lacks training… and common sense.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's a liability…\"</p>\n<p>\"I'll be damned if I don't know that,\" Makar growled, \"but when the direwolves come back, or those giant insects attack, or the dead walk from their graves, we need to take risks.\"</p>\n<p>\"Strazhland is a rough place, it seems.\"</p>\n<p>\"Rougher than you think. What about your silent friend? Those arms can handle a weapon I'm sure.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm… not a fighter,\" Erakho said, his eyes darting. \"I'm a cleaner.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ah, I did not realise, without the red chain.\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't blame you,\" the half-orc said. \"I don't have to wear it off-duty, so I don't.\"</p>\n<p>\"A chain?\" Osten asked. It strayed far from the topic at hand, but he could not help his curiosity.</p>\n<p>\"Cleaners like me wear it around their necks, so people know to stay away. We handle filthy things. Don't want disease spreading, so it's necessary. But that chain… I don't like it much.\"</p>\n<p>Osten suppressed a shiver. A chain around the neck, in this cold? Cruelty, plain and simple.</p>\n<p>\"You're doing crucial work,\" Makar said. \"The chain should be cause for pride.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" Erakho said, \"it should be.\"</p>\n<p>A heavy silence, filled with loud thoughts. Then, Makar spoke:</p>\n<p>\"You'll have your weapons back. But if it's not too much trouble, come back some time. About the job, but about something else too.\"</p>\n<p>Osten looked up questioningly. The lieutenant seemed to struggle with his words, tapping his fingers on the table and sighing.</p>\n<p>\"I'm not as concerned you'll be a danger to the city,\" he said at last. \"More worried you'll be a danger to yourself. Something's eating at you, isn't it.\"</p>\n<p><em>Shifting shadows and bone-grasping cold; the rushing sound of the river he would never return from. A feeble voice seeking him through the darkness, calling his name.</em></p>\n<p>\"I'm all right,\" he said, his voice hollow in his ears.</p>\n<p>\"You're young, still. Trust me son; silence will not help you.\"</p>\n<p>\"I… I will know where to find you.\"</p>\n<p>He stood, and would have fallen if not for Erakho.</p>\n<p>\"You still need rest,\" the half-orc growled.</p>\n<p>\"You could sleep here,\" Makar offered. \"I don't think this cold would do you good.\"</p>\n<p>\"He will sleep here,\" Erakho said. \"I'm not carrying him back, and he's burning up.\"</p>\n<p>Osten's head spun; he could not stop shivering. \"The cold,\" he muttered through chattering teeth. \"The cold…\"</p>\n<p>\"You know what,\" Erakho said, \"I'm sleeping here too. I'll apologise to mum in the morning. You're short on healers right? I'll watch over him so he doesn't eat his tongue in his sleep, or something.\"</p>\n<p>\"Um… appreciated. Have you introduced yourself?\"</p>\n<p>\"Erakho. I'm not rude. I just don't have a father.\"</p>\n<p>Makar led them to two empty beds in a corner of a small infirmary; two other occupants were fast asleep.</p>\n<p>\"I'll check on you in the morning,\" Makar said as he withdrew.</p>\n<p>\"Appreciate it,\" Erakho mumbled to himself after the door had closed. \"Second night of keeping you alive, eh?\"</p>\n<p>With surprising care for someone of his build, he helped Osten remove his tunic and trousers, and settled him into bed. He searched the infirmary for herbs his mother had fed him when he was sick. He lay a damp cloth on Osten's forehead to break his fever, then lay in the unfamiliar bed and listened as sleep eluded him.</p>"

          "content": "<p>When she first saw the man, Yanka thought she was still dreaming. He stood by her narrow bed in the guardswomen's barracks, motionless as if watching her slumber. He seemed an apparition, a vision of an impossible creature. His skin was bone white in the gloom, his fine features unsettling in their perfection. His beard was elegantly trimmed to a point, giving him a villainous flair. His shoulder-length hair was glossy black with a hint of deep green, framing his face in waves. His clothes were clearly tailored, with dark trousers showing the shape of his legs, a gold-gleaming seam running up their side. He wore a short tunic, wine red in the darkness, the fabric folding like syrup at his waist. A thin leather belt worked in intricate patterns and set with gleaming studs held the garment in place. Slung over his shoulders as if in haste, a heavy coat covered his arms. The collar twinkled with sprinkled stars, its lapels set with tiny gems. The sleeves were embroidered with gold thread on royal purple velvet. A thin gold circlet on his forehead completed the regal appearance, the metal worked in flowing shapes like mist solidified. A dream of a king from a faraway land, she thought. Then the man touched her cheek.</p>\n<p>\"Here you are, my little snow bunny,\" he said in a fond tone. \"I've been searching all over Strazhland for you. My wife is so very anxious to have you back home.\"</p>\n<p>\"Who… are you?\" She managed, her voice strangled.</p>\n<p>He frowned, his features taking on an impression of pity. \"You poor thing. Your memory is damaged, isn't it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you know me?\" She would remember a man of such beauty and opulence, certainly?</p>\n<p>\"Ah, my poor Snowdrop. You are my lady wife's favourite. We will return these elusive memories in a moment. You need but come with me.\"</p>\n<p>\"Where?\"</p>\n<p>\"Back home, of course,\" he murmured. \"Where you know you belong.\"</p>\n<p>She found herself leaning into his touch as she rose out of her bed. What was she doing here anyway? The other women slept in the long room, undisturbed by the man's presence. How they were missing out! Yanka knew she was chosen by him, lifted from the dirty masses of Krasnograd. He was here to deliver her from her miserable life. She would never need to run, now.</p>\n<p>She had been running. From village to town, through forests and rocky hills. She'd stumbled along the path of rushing rivers, their waters white as they roared towards the sea. Running from what? The man smiled at her, but something wasn't right. He'd spoken with the fondness a child would have for a pet crow, a farmer for his favourite goat. Not as person to person, but as person to thing. Well, nobles had little regard for the common folk. Yanka was special even so. Something nagged at the back of her mind, a pesky memory like a bothersome smell. Dusty and sickening. She'd hated that smell on her. She'd loathed the feel of it, the soft yet dry weave on her skin. As she mechanically picked up her cloak and settled it on her shoulders, her mind strained towards the unpleasant memory. It evaded her thoughts, slipping away like tendrils of mist. Frowning in spite of herself, she drew the dry smell deep into her lungs. The skin on her arms itched with half-remembered sensation. Her mouth twisted in disgust, and finally she knew.</p>\n<p>Silk. She hated the smell of silk.</p>\n<p>She found herself following the man out of the building. One step from the door, she stopped. He was ahead of her, leading the way into the moonlit courtyard. Under the milky light his features looked sharper, his eyes burning with impatience as he turned to beckon her. Words piled up in her throat and her breath came in short gasps. She didn't know who he was. She didn't know where he meant to take her. She only knew she didn't want to go, not for her life. She took a step back, her body going cold and numb.</p>\n<p>He clicked his tongue in annoyance, and immediately composed himself again. \"Come now, Snowdrop,\" he coaxed.</p>\n<p>His voice was irresistible, bursting with unspoken promises of luxury and idleness. She longed to take the white hand he stretched towards her… but… the smell of silk clung to him and turned her stomach. She shook her head. This time his smile had nothing of fondness or temptation; he bared his teeth at her and where the canines should have been, fangs glistened in the moonlight. A weapon… Yanka searched in vain for her dagger. She could run back in. He'd only follow. Words tugged at her memory, and without thinking she shouted:</p>\n<p>\"You're no longer welcome! You may not come in!\"</p>\n<p>The man recoiled as if hit, just short of the threshold. His face was inhuman and cruel now.</p>\n<p>\"I will return,\" he hissed. \"There is always someone to let me in. I will have you.\"</p>\n<p>In a burst of dark magic and a flutter of wings, he disappeared. Left alone, the door gaping open and the cold creeping in, Yanka fought for control over herself. For agonising seconds she willed her cold limbs to move, until she could step forward and slam the door shut. She rammed the iron bolt into place, and let the bar fall into its hooks. Then all strength drained out of her and she slumped to the foot of the wall, shaking uncontrollably.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Stanislav woke to a hand over his mouth and a blade at his throat. He remained very still, barely breathing as his aching mind raced.</p>\n<p>\"Not a sound, or I'll kill you,\" a female voice whispered in his ear. \"Come with me and I'll let you live.\"</p>\n<p>He waited excruciating seconds for the cold metal to leave his neck. He gave a tiny nod, raising open hands towards his… aggressor? She was a small woman, light of build with a natural feline grace. She wore the greys and greens of a scout, the tight uniform emphasising her figure. The darkness was nothing to his eyes, and he freely took in her tilted eyes, her pale skin, her small nose, and her thin lips. She was beautiful. He mentally kicked himself for noticing these things not a full minute after she had threatened to slit his throat.</p>\n<p>\"Where?\" He said hoarsely.</p>\n<p>\"Out. Take all you have.\"</p>\n<p>He obeyed, not so much out of fear for his life but rather out of curiosity. Now her knife wasn't on his skin, he could easily drop her with a spell and wake the guardsmen. He chose not to. His blood beat at his temples, roaring in his ears. He had to make an effort to control his breathing, and found himself licking his lips. As quietly as he could, he gathered his few belongings, shrugged into his cloak, and slung his pack over his shoulder. The man next to him muttered and rolled over, but did not wake. Stanislav exhaled in relief as he gripped his staff with bloodless knuckles. He would have clubbed the man over the head. He was glad he did not have to. He tiptoed out of the barracks at her urging, exiting to biting cold. The mists spread the moonlight over the city and the snow shimmered in the ghostly light. It was plenty to see by even for normal eyes, he supposed. Once she had shut the door behind them without so much as a click, she turned towards him again.</p>\n<p>\"We're leaving the city and going north.\"</p>\n<p>\"At this hour?\" He said.</p>\n<p>\"Particularly at this hour,\" she hissed. \"As fast as we can. I just need to drop by a place on the way.\"</p>\n<p>\"I can't. I have a job here.\"</p>\n<p>\"You have a job with me now.\"</p>\n<p>He hesitated. \"You can pay me more?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>He doubted it, but her blue eyes never wavered. \"You're fleeing,\" he realised in a whisper.</p>\n<p>\"None of your business. Follow me now.\"</p>\n<p>He lunged forward and grabbed her arm. As he expected, she was thin under the warm uniform. Her wrist was brittle as a branch under his fingers. \"Tell me what you're running from.\"</p>\n<p>Suddenly he wasn't holding her anymore. His fingers found air where her delicate wrist had been and her blade was at his throat once more, her other hand gripping his hair.</p>\n<p>\"I pay you, you do what I say,\" she snarled. \"Or I silence you.\"</p>\n<p>He considered taunting her; certainly such a pretty young thing had never killed before. The words died unspoken. With her face so close to his, he saw into the hood of her cloak. Her long ears ended in points.</p>\n<p>\"You're an elf,\" he breathed.</p>\n<p>\"How observant,\" she said in a snarky tone. \"Are you going to be sensible now?\"</p>\n<p>\"Lower your blade,\" he said. \"I'll follow you.\"</p>\n<p>\"I very much doubt that. You're going first.\"</p>\n<p>She walked right behind him, no doubt with her dagger at his back as she led him towards the gates.</p>\n<p>\"How are we leaving the barracks?\" He whispered urgently.</p>\n<p>\"Can you use magic on the guards?\"</p>\n<p>\"Not unless want me to kill them.\"</p>\n<p>She swore under her breath. \"Let's do this the old-fashioned way, then.\"</p>\n<p>Dragging him to a shadowy corner close to the gate, she took her dagger between her teeth and picked up a handful of snow, packing it into a tight ball. She retrieved her weapon, drew her arm back, and launched the snowball across the courtyard. The commotion drew the lone guard's attention and he left his post to investigate, long enough for the two of them to sneak out. She led him along dark streets to a house that seemed abandoned.</p>\n<p>\"Wait here,\" she snapped.</p>\n<p>Before he could make a witty reply, she sheathed her dagger and jumped up, scaling the wall. She moved like a shadow, or maybe a spider. She disappeared onto the roof and he waited uneasily, not hearing a sound. Stanislav decided to keep watch and he scanned the street in both directions, his eyes useless against the swirling mist. There were no street lamps here so he strained his ears. There was a small sound above, and the elf dropped down next to him with a bundle strapped to her back. He bit back a shout. He had not heard her climb down at all. She eyed him coldly.</p>\n<p>\"Now we leave the city.\"</p>\n<p>\"The gates are closed at night. You can't just snowball your way out of this one.\"</p>\n<p>\"We're not going through the gates. I know a place.\"</p>\n<p>The place turned out to be an iron grate in the wall, to which a shallow canal led. The water was black in the darkness, and without touching it Stanislav knew it was ice cold.</p>\n<p>\"Reassure me,\" he said, \"we're not wading through?\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course not. I've been scraping at this stone for the past two months, it should come loose.\"</p>\n<p>She crept to the foot of the wall and started pushing at one of the building blocks. Upon closer inspection, Stanislav saw the mortar was indeed very damaged, but would it be enough to move the enormous slab of stone? He watched the elf struggle, but the stone did not budge. At her urging, he gave it a try as well. The stone was loose, but not enough to be moved by someone his strength. He was all too aware of time passing, of the moon travelling across the shrouded sky. Dawn was still a couple hours away, but a patrol could come anytime. He supposed it was not too likely; the stream was full of refuse, most of which remained stuck in the grate, and the smell made his eyes water. Even with the reek, once dawn came they would be all too exposed.</p>\n<p>\"Stand back,\" he sighed. \"And be ready to run.\"</p>\n<p>She looked up at him, but said nothing as she retreated. Stanislav raised his hand and felt his eyes grow cold as he called upon his magic. The power filled his mind, more intoxicating than liquor, more enticing than a woman's touch. He allowed himself a few seconds to delight in it, to drink in the darkness of his magic. He bathed in its cold, revelled in the flow of power. He could do anything. He could reduce this entire wall to rubble. A smile tugged at his lips. Reluctantly, he formed the spell and released it. A dark blast streaked towards the wall and hit the stone; the explosion shook chunks from the wall, and chips of mortar rained into the canal. The dust fell, revealing a hole where the loose stone had been. The block had been blown cleanly a metre out of the city. To her credit, the elf didn't stand and stare. She crouched, and took off at a dead run through the wall. Stanislav followed at a jog, already hearing startled voices behind him.</p>\n<p>They ran as far as they could, following the river until they came to a coppice of weeping willows, their branches aflame with the colours of autumn. They all but dove into the trees and abundant shrubbery, Stanislav breathing hard as he crouched behind a bush, silvery in the darkness. He had to lower one knee to the ground, leaning on his fist until the pain in his side began to subside. Weak grey light trickled through the leaves.</p>\n<p>\"Whatever is chasing you,\" he panted, \"I sure hope it won't track us.\"</p>\n<p>\"It will,\" she said. Infuriatingly, she wasn't gasping for breath. \"We're only stopping until you catch your breath. Then it's time for stealth.\"</p>\n<p><em>Blowing up that wall wasn't exactly stealthy</em>, he grumbled inwardly. What had he got himself dragged into? For a pretty face, of all things. He shook his head. Her beauty hadn't convinced him. Waking to find his life threatened had done it. His heart had been pounding out of his chest, his mind instantly awake. He had forgotten everything except survival and the blood rushing through his veins. On the verge of death, he had felt so painfully alive. Besides, secrets had a nasty habit of hiding other secrets. It was just a hunch but he hoped following her would lead him to more power. Even if it just meant being free to use his spells, he would take the chance. What kind of officer scolded his soldiers for fighting, anyway?</p>\n<p>\"Answer me one thing at least,\" he said. \"Why me?\"</p>\n<p>\"Because you're a mage.\"</p>\n<p>\"Do I… know you?\"</p>\n<p>\"I suppose not,\" she said hesitantly. \"But I heard Makar tell you off for using your magic. So you must be powerful.\"</p>\n<p>He frowned. \"You heard him?\"</p>\n<p>\"I eavesdropped,\" she admitted.</p>\n<p>\"Of course,\" he sighed. \"And may I know the name of my new employer?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yanka. And you're… Stanislav, was it?\"</p>\n<p>\"That would be my name.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well met, Stanislav.\"</p>\n<p>He could not help but chuckle. \"It's the first time I hear this from someone <em>after</em> she put a knife to my throat.\"</p>\n<p>She shrugged. \"Needs must.\"</p>\n<p>He had expected some kind of embarrassment, but he was disappointed. \"What are you running from, anyway?\" He asked again.</p>\n<p>\"My past,\" she said. \"Not that I can remember it.\"</p>\n<p>He only had more questions, but she shot him a hard look. \"If you can chatter, you can run. Let's go.\"</p>\n<p>He snapped his mouth shut and followed her through the forest.</p>"

          "content": "<p>Makar woke at dawn with a distinct premonition; today would be a bad day. He wasted no time in trying to convince himself it was just a figment of his imagination; instead he got up and dressed and set to expecting the worst. He tucked his linen shirt into his trousers and tied them at the waist. He slung on his tabard and fastened the thin leather belt over it. He shaved and washed his face, scrubbed his teeth, and combed his hair just once. The water in the pitcher was cold but it had not frozen. As he emptied the washbasin out the window, the night's dream brushed against his consciousness, leaving an ache deep in his chest. Someone had spoken to him as he slept… he strained his mind, trying to remember. Like trying to catch mist. With a sigh, he abandoned the impossible task. The memory would return, or it would not. He had more immediate worries to address. Stretching, he left his quarters. He was on his guard with every step, as if expecting an attack in the guardhouse itself. That was unlikely of course, but an attack was not necessarily a dozen of beastmen charging in with fangs bared and claws seeking men's pulses. He had a quiet breakfast of bread and soup made of yesterday's leftovers and just as he exited the mess hall, his intuition materialised in the shape of a round, balding man dressed in faded velvets and moth-eaten lace.</p><p>\"Sergeant Semyonovich?\" The man asked, mopping the sweat from his forehead.</p><p>\"I am he,\" Makar said.</p><p>\"A word in private. My master has a task for you.\"</p><p>The soldier nodded and led the fat man into his office. The room was cramped with chests of drawers, cabinets containing maps, and endless reports bound in scrap fabric. Makar's desk, which he seldom used, had been varnished once but now bore the scars of many administrative battles. He sat in his chair, motioning for the visitor to take the other seat across the desk. What could bring a burgher to a guardhouse? Why had the man come himself, instead of sending a messenger? Makar controlled his anxiety, not without effort.</p><p>\"What's this urgent task, then?\" He asked, his hands steady on the desk.</p><p>\"Well first off… ahem. Ippolit Valeryevich, in humble service to our lord and master Alwin Rurik von Muratova-Finsterthal…\"</p><p>Makar motioned impatiently for the man to get to the point. The burgher gulped audibly.</p><p>\"In the name of… ah… um… you are currently sheltering a criminal, a pale elf female with blue eyes and red-brown hair. You are to deliver her to Castle Krasnograd by this evening and no later.\"</p><p>The soldier kept a blank face, though his heart was pounding. \"What crimes has she committed?\"</p><p>\"That is none of your concern,\" Ippolit snapped. \"You are to produce her by tonight.\"</p><p>\"Will she be judged then?\"</p><p>The round man drew himself up. \"You are overstepping yourself. I give you an order, you follow it. Questioning me is questioning our lord's authority.\"</p><p>\"Very well,\" Makar sighed. \"This was too important to send a courier, I take it?\"</p><p>\"That is…\" he began, and stopped himself, glaring. \"This conversation is at an end. You have your orders.\"</p><p>Without waiting for a reply, the burgher dropped from his chair and waddled to the door. He put a pudgy hand on the doorknob but before he could make a move to leave, the door opened from the outside, nearly knocking the burgher down to the floor. Not that the fall would hurt him much. Makar had to bite his lip to conceal a smile. The arrival of his deputy Samuil put a abrupt end to his amusement.</p><p>\"Sergeant,\" the scarred man said as he saluted. \"There was an attack during the night.\"</p><p>\"Where?\"</p><p>\"By one of the canals.\"</p><p>Samuil stepped right up to the desk, pulling out a roughly drawn map of the immediate surroundings. He pointed to a circled spot with a gloved finger.</p><p>\"There was no intrusion the patrol could see,\" he continued, \"but there is a gaping hole in the wall.\"</p><p>\"A hole? In the city wall?\"</p><p>\"I did not believe it myself, sir.\"</p><p>\"With all due respect, Samuil…\"</p><p>\"It's real, Makar,\" the man said in a lower tone. \"The patrol healer said she sees traces of magic. Someone blew up part of the wall.\"</p><p>Next to the door, the all-but forgotten burgher made a strangled noise, and ran out of the office.</p><p>\"Who was that?\" Samuil asked absentmindedly.</p><p>\"More trouble,\" the sergeant sighed. \"I want to see that wall with my own eyes, but first I need to find our new scout.\"</p><p>\"The elf?\"</p><p>The voice from Makar's dreams flitted closer to his consciousness, lingering just under the surface of his mind.</p><p>\"The elf,\" he confirmed. \"I need to speak with her. And also check on two men in the south wing infirmary. Hopefully both are alive.\"</p><p>Samuil raised an eyebrow but said nothing, falling into step behind Makar as he left the office. Through wooden corridors creaking in the morning's cold, they made for the closest destination, the guardswomen's barracks. Entry was denied to men, so the sergeant rapped on the banded pine door. It opened almost immediately, and he looked down on a diminutive blonde woman, one of his best scouts. Her hair was in disarray and she stifled a yawn.</p><p>\"Makar? It's ungodly early.\"</p><p>\"Sorry to disturb, Nastka. I need to speak with Yanka, it is urgent.\"</p><p>\"The elf?\"</p><p>\"The very same.\"</p><p>\"You're out of luck,\" she grimaced. \"She snuck off last night. Her bed is cold, all her stuff is gone.\"</p><p>Makar bit back an oath as his insides twisted, the premonition he had upon waking taunting him. \"Any idea why?\" He prompted.</p><p>Nastka shrugged. \"Second thoughts? She seemed shady. Good riddance if you ask me.\"</p><p>\"You're probably right.\" He forced a smile. \"Pardon the intrusion, my lady. I'll leave you to your morning rituals.\"</p><p>She giggled at the mock formality. \"Same ritual for us all, m'lord. Ten laps of the yard, then off to breakfast.\"</p><p>\"All the same, I leave you to it. Good day.\"</p><p>She saluted and he left, Samuil shadowing him.</p><p>\"That's hardly a coincidence,\" the scarred man muttered.</p><p>\"No doubt about that,\" Makar said. \"All the more reason to find her.\"</p><p>\"She could be anywhere in Krasnograd by now!\"</p><p>\"Or out of it,\" the sergeant said, his heart sinking.</p><p>\"To the wall, then?\"</p><p>\"The infirmary first. I want to check on last night's visitors.\"</p><p>The small room was one of several infirmaries in the complex, holding only six beds. Disease being common, it was built with the idea to quarantine people early on to nip the epidemy in the bud, but it had never really worked. There were just too many people milling around the barracks, and by the time they started sneezing, the healers said, they had already passed on the disease. The sickrooms served mostly for the very ill or the severely injured who needed calm more desperately than the others. Makar nodded to the other two men present, though one was sleeping off a bad flu, judging by the colour of his nose. The other one was stretching his shoulders and arms as his right leg was bound to wooden splints. At the far end of the room, Erakho was just putting on his coat and Osten was sitting up in bed, still in his shirt.</p><p>\"Gentlemen,\" Makar said, spreading out his arms in greeting. \"I see the night treated you well?\"</p><p>\"As well as it could, considering,\" the half-orc muttered. \"But he's alive so I must have done something right.\"</p><p>\"I'm right here,\" Osten said, though a grin betrayed his stern tone.</p><p>\"Good for you,\" Erakho retorted, \"you're staying here. And resting. You're still tired.\"</p><p>\"I'm feeling fine now.\"</p><p>Erakho shook his head. \"None of that from you. You near collapsed from overexerting yourself.\"</p><p>\"You can stay here and rest a few days,\" Makar said. \"I can give you tasks that won't tax you. Can you read and write?\"</p><p>\"In the common tongue, yes,\" the blond man said.</p><p>He was still pale, and his eyes were marked by fatigue. He could probably be made to do inventory of supplies, or help prepare food. It didn't take a lot of stamina to peel potatoes. His strength clearly lay elsewhere, but as much as Makar wanted to see Osten fight, he would not put so much as a quarterstaff in his hands now. A broom, maybe. Even as he considered Osten, the sergeant felt Erakho's eyes on him; a piercing, searching gaze that began to make him uncomfortable. Makar opened his mouth to ask the reason for this scrutiny when the memory hit him with the force of an avalanche. It was only a whisper drifting from the mists of his dreams, but it was <em>her</em> voice. As he slept he had seen Inessa's warm eyes, from a time before the world's lights went out. Her soft whisper was almost a brush on his skin as she murmured… <em>follow her</em>. Makar blinked away tears, his chest hollow. Most days he kept himself busy and took care of the living instead of mourning the dead, but the pain was never far. Years ago now, a part of him had been torn out; the pain would never fade completely. The sergeant struggled to bring his mind back to the present, to keep his face calm and friendly. Erakho's eyes seemed to see right through his façade as he asked:</p><p>\"Are you all right? You look like you've seen a ghost.\"</p><p><em>Heard one, maybe</em>, Makar thought with crushing sorrow. He felt Samuil's concern from behind him. He had to be in control. He had to play it off as he always did, laugh and joke and reassure everyone. Time had not healed his wounds in the slightest; he had merely learnt to distract people from them.</p><p>\"No ghosts here that I can see,\" he forced out. \"But there is a matter of some concern to me.\"</p><p>It was really just a hunch. Erakho's green-brown eyes never shifted; anyone else would have snapped at him for staring. He was a cleaner, but…</p><p>\"Erakho.\" It sounded like a plea. Makar cleared his throat. \"You said you have a job but by any chance, do you have skills in tracking? Say, finding a missing person.\"</p><p>The half-orc blinked, taken aback. \"I… would not say so. Not in a… conventional sense, at least.\"</p><p>Makar's eyes narrowed. \"Explain.\"</p><p>\"Well…\" He shifted his feet, finally breaking eye contact as he looked around the room. \"Usually people don't like to hear about it. But let's say, when you don't know where someone has gone, in a city this size, there are plenty of eyes, ears, and noses which could have noticed your person. I just tend to ask where others can't.\"</p><p>\"You can use magic,\" Makar guessed from the evasive response.</p><p>\"A little bit,\" the big man admitted.</p><p>\"In a way that can help me find someone.\"</p><p>\"Possibly.\"</p><p>\"Who are you working for?\"</p><p>\"An orc named Zakhar. Cleaning duties. We get ordered to a different place each day.\"</p><p>\"Not a problem, I'll have someone find him. I'm borrowing your talents for the time being.\"</p><p>\"You… might well be disappointed,\" Erakho warned.</p><p>\"Chances are I'll survive that,\" Makar said and motioned to Samuil to find a messenger. \"You two are my guests for the time being but don't worry, I'll put you to work soon enough. I need to see to something. It won't take long, so in the meantime I'd suggest you go have some breakfast, inform any relatives of your change of employment. And gather anything you may need for a search. Osten, you may have your weapons back but please have a care for your health.\"</p><p>Both men nodded. As Makar turned to leave to finally inspect that wall, a lanky guard came running in.</p><p>\"Sergeant,\" he panted, \"I've been looking for you everywhere.\"</p><p>\"Catch your breath man. What is it?\"</p><p>\"Stanislav's gone. Weapons and all. Like he's never been here in the first place.\"</p><p>Makar sighed.</p><hr><p>There was a hole in the wall. Even at this early hour the place was full of people; curious bystanders, guards trying to maintain a semblance of order, masons awaiting instructions. Makar even spotted another burgher in a crimson dress and fur-lined cloak who was very obviously pressing a handkerchief to her nose. The towering wall was not in danger of collapsing from one missing stone, even considering the size of its building blocks. The missing stone had been dragged just outside the hole, with barely enough space to squeeze through the gap. Despite the use of magic, the stone itself wasn't very damaged. The grey mortar was almost gone, and it looked like the stone had been pushed out with overwhelming force. He rested his hand on the smooth stone, blueish from the presence of fool's silver. Chips of mica scattered inside gave it a starry glitter. It was Mourning slate, brought all the way from the quarries at the foot of the Mountains of Mourning. Makar could not begin to imagine how much it had cost to build this wall, hundreds of years ago; how many backs had been broken in the process. He waved to a small man in a scout's uniform.</p><p>\"Any clues here?\"</p><p>\"One set of footprints for sure,\" the scout said. \"Probably a human judging by the depth and size. The snow was disturbed outside, but with the snowfall and wind last night, I can't really make out anything. We'll need hounds, if they can still smell anything in this cold.\"</p><p>\"We'd need wolves,\" Makar muttered.</p><p>The scout shrugged. \"I'll be honest, we might need a small miracle to track whoever went through. We'll try. Can't guarantee anything.\"</p><p>\"Do your best,\" Makar said, giving the man a pat on the shoulder as he ran off.</p><p>He didn't exactly have a miracle at hand. Or did he?</p><hr><p>Erakho jogged through half-frozen streets, paying little attention to his footing. He slipped several times, fell once and scrambled to his feet. When he reached the backyard he spotted whiskers poking out of the crack in the wall. Smula the rat rushed out to meet him, her squeaks incomprehensible to him.</p><p>\"Sorry friend, I can't understand you now. The magic isn't here. I need to check on mum.\"</p><p>He hoped she understood. He could not spare a moment to cast the spell. His hands shook as he unlocked the door and struggled out of his boots, scattering snow inside. He stumbled through the kitchen and into the small room beyond, where Valya was sitting slumped on one of the benches, her head atop her arms. She'd fallen asleep on the table, but she woke up as he approached. Her eyes widened and she jumped up, rushed to Erakho and caught him in a hug.</p><p>\"Where were you?\" She cried, her voice rough with sleep. \"I was so worried!\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry mum,\" he said, hugging her back. \"I'm so sorry. I'll explain everything, let me make you some tea.\"</p><p>She stepped back reluctantly, her eyes shining. With a stab of guilt to his gut, Erakho squeezed her hand before he returned to the kitchen. He swept out the snow he'd brought in then filled the pot with clean snow from the barrel, packing it in. He carried the black iron pot to the living room and hung it from the hook. Examining the fireplace, he grimaced. There wasn't so much as an ember left. The fire was dead, the place freezing. He stomped back outside to the lumber pile, picking up dry pine logs and thinner branches to serve as fire starters. He set the branches in a little heap and closed his eyes for a second, calling the land's whispers to him. He sensed threads of magic around him and guided one to the fireplace. As he opened his eyes, smoke rose from the branches and sparks soon began to crackle. He fed more pine to the fire and was soon rewarded with high yellow flames. The snow in the pot melted in no time, and it took only minutes before he sat at the table with his mother, both of them cradling hot mugs in the warming air. Erakho explained the situation with Osten, and why he had stayed overnight to watch over him. Valya relaxed, her shoulders slumping under the patched blanket she had draped over herself.</p><p>\"And now I'm being, ah, employed by the sergeant, to find a missing person.\"</p><p>\"Won't that be dangerous?\" She asked anxiously.</p><p>\"Not more than working for that bully Zakhar,\" he grumbled. \"It will be fine I'm sure. But I don't know how long it will take, or if I'm going to be away from home.\"</p><p>\"You're still so young…\"</p><p>\"I won't be alone, mum.\"</p><p>\"I have a bad feeling nonetheless,\" she said. \"Why you?\"</p><p>\"I'm not sure. Because of my magic I guess.\"</p><p>\"What use would the town guard have for talking to rats?\"</p><p>\"Well… it's on me really, I offered. People don't pay attention to small animals but they are everywhere. They notice things, it's a matter of survival for them. Not just rats; there's a lot of bats here, cats and dogs, a good amount of birds…\"</p><p>\"Magic is dangerous,\" she said as she sipped her tea.</p><p>\"I know. I'll be careful.\"</p><p>\"As long as you come back to me in good health,\" she sighed.</p><p>\"Always,\" he promised.</p><p>\"Then you better not keep the sergeant waiting. If you're looking for a lost person, every moment could count.\"</p><p>He nodded and gulped down his tea, the hot drink burning his throat as he stood and headed upstairs into his room. What would he need to take with him? He had a threadbare backpack he used to carry food in when he had time to go to market. It may not last long, but it would have to do. He packed spare clothes, his razor, a piece of soap, a blanket. He only had the one pair of boots but they were good boots, broken in and sturdy. Better remember to get his boot grips as well. He took his treasures, a leather pouch filled with things he had collected over the years. It held leaves and feathers, stones, and even bits of insects. He wasn't too sure why he had picked them up but each of the little treasures seemed to whisper to him and he was reluctant to part with them regardless of their supposed lack of value. He took his waterskin and his walking staff. He always had a knife at his belt, a heavy hunting knife he'd had to use at his work a couple times. It had been a coming-of-age present; the handle was worn smooth and seemed to fit perfectly into his hand.</p><p>As he ran down the stairs, Valya gave him a small leather scrip which he immediately recognised.</p><p>\"You'll need these more than me, so no arguing,\" she said sternly. \"I can get more herbs. You may not have time to stop and pick leaves.\"</p><p>\"Are you sure?\"</p><p>She nodded, smiling to banish the worry in her eyes. \"Maybe you will find someone who needs them even more than either of us.\"</p><p>He took the pouch of herbs with reverence. \"I'll use them well.\"</p><p>\"Of course you will. I've taught you properly, have I not?\"</p><p>\"I'll miss you, mum.\"</p><p>\"Only for a short while. I'll be here waiting for you.\"</p><p>\"The rats will watch over you in my stead.\"</p><p>\"I know. I'll keep your friends fed,\" she promised. \"Off with you now. Take care of yourself. Always remember you are the light of my life.\"</p><p>\"I love you, mum.\"</p><p>And with one last hug, Erakho was gone.</p><hr><p>\"You're going to ask <em>animals</em>?\"</p><p>Erakho nodded. \"People don't know where your elf lady went, do they?\"</p><p>\"I suppose not,\" Makar said. \"So how does the spell work?\"</p><p>\"We're going to need a lot of food.\"</p><p>\"As a spell component?\"</p><p>Erakho smiled. \"As a bribe.\"</p><p>With Osten's help they gathered scraps of meat and vegetables, dry heels of bread, cheese from which small bits of salt seeped out, and even some grain. They sat in the courtyard at first for a wide sweep, as Erakho thought of it. Pigeons and crows came first, cooing and cawing as they spotted the scattered grain. To the half-orc who performed the ritual, these sounds made sense and he could translate them to the common tongue with ease.</p><p>\"You can really… understand them?\" Osten asked.</p><p>\"Yes. They're mostly squawking over the food now, but once they've had some we can have a conversation.\"</p><p>The prospect seemed to make him deeply uneasy, but Erakho ignored it and focused on the birds. When he spoke, his words sounded normal to him until the magic snatched them from the air and warped them into sounds the animals would understand. For birds it was mostly sound. For most beasts, some words would be magically translated to smells. The bigger part of their communication was missing, as even magic could not create the twitch of a tail or the flap of a wing, but it carried intention and that was enough.</p><p>\"Have you seen an elf?\" He asked the birds, \"pale skin and red-brown hair, wearing the colours of the forest?\"</p><p>There were many responses amidst fluttering feathers, none very informative. People made no sense to animals, who ignored them unless threatened… or bribed. Erakho had prepared with this in mind.</p><p>\"Tell your friends,\" he said. \"There is food for those who have seen her. There is warmth and care for those who want it. Tell your family and your allies.\"</p><p>The birds dispersed and only a few minutes later a new flock arrived. One crow had seen her, she claimed, climbing up to a roof and disappearing through a hole in the tiles. She had a friend with her, the bird said, another person. Erakho tried to pry, but the bird had flown away to sleep without investigating further. He got similar answers over the course of two hours (and as many wild magic surges).</p><p>\"It definitely happened at night,\" he said to the other men. \"We should be asking owls and foxes. Cats, if we can find one who was nearby.\"</p><p>\"Lead the way,\" Makar said.</p><p>\"I'll leave you to it. I'm staying here and getting some rest.\"</p><p>Osten was pale as he shuffled off to the infirmary. The other two left the courtyard and walked through the streets, following the vague directions Erakho had pieced together. He was focused on his task and initially didn't notice Makar was speaking to him.</p><p>\"You are practiced in medicine?\" The soldier asked again.</p><p>\"Somewhat. My mum is good with herbs, she taught me. Magic can help.\"</p><p>\"Good. If this man hunt, or woman hunt as it were, went wrong, I can count on your skills.\"</p><p>He made it sound like a question. \"Sure. You're paying me now.\"</p><p>Makar chuckled. \"That's one reason, I suppose.\"</p><p>\"What other reason is there to work?\" Erakho asked absentmindedly.</p><p>\"Many. It depends. You're wearing your chain. I thought you didn't like it?\"</p><p>\"Force of habit.\"</p><p>\"As good a reason as any.\"</p><p>\"I think that's the roof the crows meant, maybe.\"</p><p>They stopped and examined their surroundings. It was a narrow street made darker by the overhangs from the houses' second stories. The ground would have been churned to mud if it wasn't frozen over. Erakho licked his lips and tilted his head up, closing his eyes and focusing with all his might. Crows had mentioned a warm updraft, a feature more meaningful to them than any visual elements. For a flightless creature, it was all but impossible to find. Sighing, Erakho looked back down and searched for cracks in the walls. Rats tended to be forthcoming with information, for the right price (usually, cheese). They had a fondness for gossip, little of which was reliable. Sometimes the rodents told stories to one another for the sole pleasure of inventing and exaggerating grand feats.</p><p>He performed the ritual again, without any side effects. Dropping crumbs at the foot of walls, he waited — but did not have to wait long. Quivering noses and whiskers appeared, and tiny paws reached for the food. Erakho began asking his questions again, mentally filtering out the less-than-useful answers.</p><p>\"I saw her,\" said a young rat with a notched ear. \"Up the wall, not a sound, like a spider.\"</p><p>\"Where did she go after that?\"</p><p>\"Into the attic and back down. Another person, human smell, male smell, magic smell. They left together.\"</p><p>\"Which direction did they take?\"</p><p>\"That of danger!\" The rat squeaked. \"There, we don't go. Claws and fangs, quick in the dark.\"</p><p>The little rodent had communicated direction by pointing down the street with his nose, whiskers trembling. Erakho pulled a piece of cheese from his pocket and placed it in front of the rat, who pounced on it.</p><p>\"How very generous!\" He squeaked around a mouthful of cheese. \"Watch yourself if you follow. You are big, but claws are sharp.\"</p><p>\"Thank you, little one. I will be careful.\"</p><p>\"Bring more food some time.\"</p><p>Erakho straightened and stretched his back as he reported to Makar.</p><p>\"What do you suppose they meant by claws?\" The sergeant asked.</p><p>\"A cat probably. That's good for us; cats' senses are good, and they're generally closer to people. They don't care about what we do, but they notice.\"</p><p>\"What about dogs?\" Makar asked as they walked.</p><p>\"Dogs care too much, if you can call it that. They get so excited to talk to a person, it's difficult to get any less from them than half their life story.\"</p><p>The soldier snorted with laughter, no doubt imagining it. They spent the better part of the day searching and talking; Makar asked people if they had seen Yanka, and towards the evening he added Stanislav's description. Erakho asked small animals, with widely varying results but generally the beasts proved to be more informative than the people, on account of having different sleep schedules and sharper senses. Neither were surprised when the search led them back to the hole in the city wall, which was being guarded during the investigation. The two men shuffled back to the barracks just in time for dinner. Makar seemed lost in thought and was uncommonly quiet, which Erakho appreciated; the repeated use of magic, the surges, and the many questions had left him with a splitting headache. He ate his meal with haste to escape the noise of the mess hall and retired to the infirmary where Osten was already asleep, writhing beneath his blankets as if in the clutches of a nightmare. Too tired to check on him, the half-orc stripped to his smallclothes, crept into bed and finally found restorative sleep.</p>"

          "name": "07 - The Round Turnip",
          "section": "journal-pages",
          "content": "<p>Stanislav stumbled after the elf through the snowy forest. She seemed to float above the ground, leaving shallow footprints while he struggled. Maybe she somehow walked on hidden ice every time. The mage wished he knew a spell to walk on top of snow, or erase their tracks, or melt the snow. Anything, really. Yanka had insisted on moving fast over sneaking, claiming the next snowfall would cover their tracks soon enough anyway. They still trailed pine branches behind them to muddle the tracks somewhat, though he doubted the rudimentary strategy would fool anyone. It was morning, though he could no more gauge the hour than see the sun; he only knew because they had been running most of the night and it was lighter now. Yanka had set a murderous pace, running then catching their breath at a quick walk, then running again. Stanislav did not consider himself weak by any means but this speed was taking a serious toll on him. His new employer did not seem to struggle with the pace any more than with the snow. In fact he could hardly see her most of the time as her scout's uniform made her blend into their surroundings. He only picked out her form now and then, against a backdrop of blazing red leaves. He could have kept up with the pace, a little longer at least, had his head not seemed ready to fall off his shoulders. He called for a halt, to no avail.</p>\n<p>In the moment he decided to cast a spell, Stanislav knew it was a bad idea. He wanted to blame the landscape for it. He had never been out of Krasnograd before; the twisting streets, the star-speckled Mourning slate, and the darkness had become part of him. All these bushes and trees splattered fiery colours on snow and stone; even in the weak light it was overwhelming. He had broken into another world by blasting a hole into the wall. He was chased, if only by association. Stanislav thought he was familiar with fear and he was forced to admit this was different. He knew Krasnograd well and had not thought about how vast the world outside would be, or how small he was. In the distance, the trees and shrubs blurred into a wall of crimson flame. The glittering snow left not a speck of shadow. He was too exhausted to scream so he grabbed his staff and sought magic, beckoning invisible threads to carry the words his voice could not. He whispered his plea for a halt, and let the spell carry it to Yanka. It was a basic spell, one-way telepathy, and just now it was far too much for him.</p>\n<p>With a snap, pain cracked through his head. He cried out and stumbled, tried to catch himself on the nearest tree. His hand slipped, the forest lurched around him and he found himself lying on his side in the snow, his shoulder aching but it was nothing next to the pain in his head. A presence at his side — his elven companion, quietly asking questions he could not make out. His mind blurred and the words tied themselves into a tangle without beginning nor end. He remembered hitting his head just two days prior; he had done a lot of sleeping since, but the headaches endured.</p>\n<p>\"Stanislav! Look at me!\"</p>\n<p>With an effort, eyes half-closed against the light, he turned his head. Yanka's form was fuzzy as if obscured by fog. Her pale skin seemed to melt into the grey light, ghostly and indistinct.</p>\n<p>\"I heard you, in my mind,\" she said. \"I'm sorry. I didn't realise you were so exhausted. It's light anyway, let's hide and rest. Can you walk?\"</p>\n<p>\"I can try.\" His words bounced in his skull. Pulling himself to his knees, he felt nauseous.</p>\n<p>\"You're… really pale,\" Yanka said, which was rich coming from her. \"Did you hit your head?\"</p>\n<p>\"Suppose I did. Not now. Two days ago. I was pushed, nearly cracked my skull on a rock.\"</p>\n<p>Her eyes widened. \"You did what? And you're running around?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well you didn't leave me much of a choice, did you?\"</p>\n<p>Standing, he leaned against the trunk of an ancient willow and waited for his head to stop spinning. There had been the injury at the skirmish… he thought another man would still be sleeping it off. It had been bad before he used magic, but the pain had become lightning in his head when he cast the spell. He wiped his nose with the back of his hand and groaned at a red smear on his glove. Yanka's bright blue eyes were filled with concern.</p>\n<p>\"I'll find us a good place to rest,\" she said. \"Stay here. I won't be long.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hey… wait! Don't…\"</p>\n<p>Stanislav's protests faded into the mist. He leaned his head back against the tree, tasting blood. She would not abandon him, right? Not after going through the trouble of… practically abducting him. His magic… it still worked? It had to. Why had a simple spell hurt him so much? The pain was fading now, though the earlier migraine still pulsed inside his skull. She better not lose her way. How did one tell these trees apart? Every direction looked the same. He heard a stream flowing nearby, but could not see it. There was no wind. Despite the cold, a blanket of fog covered the ground, making it difficult to gauge the depth of the snow. The mist was thicker than in the city, making his exposed face damp and numb. It seemed to curl around him with a will of its own, and he could do nothing but breathe it in, breathe in tendrils of gaseous ice trickling into his lungs. He caught himself before he could shake his head, deciding the sudden motion would not help matters. Instead of trying to ignore his surroundings, he looked inward. His eyes still scanned the forest but his mind sought the darkness within, the force behind his magic. It was unscathed; he imagined a swirl of dark smoke in his chest, but really it was nothing he had ever seen. It was an ever-present companion, like a stone in his pocket or an old scar on his finger. His mind caressed the feeling of power, shielded it, cradled it.</p>\n<p>\"I've found a spot. Come on.\"</p>\n<p>Stanislav flinched. His companion had appeared right in front of him, where he'd been looking, yet the forest had been empty one second and she had been here the next.</p>\n<p>\"How do you… do that?\" He grunted.</p>\n<p>\"Do what? Follow me, it's not far.\"</p>\n<p>Leaning on his staff, he trudged through the snow and mist, not seeing the forest around him. He watched his feet, trying to spot uneven ground or jutting rocks but to no avail; he kept tripping and stumbling. The sound of water grew louder, and they came to a rushing stream just downriver of a clear pool.</p>\n<p>\"It's just up the slope. A really good find.\"</p>\n<p>He had to admit the elf was right. The river had hollowed out a bend in the rocky soil then deserted it seasons ago, leaving a shallow dry cave. Yanka had to point it out for him as it was obscured by crimson shrubs with long, narrow leaves. In places the shrubs' branches intertwined with the hanging roots of a cluster of Dragonclaw willows, their twisting branches heavy with rust-coloured leaves. At Yanka's urging, Stanislav crept into the cave. Shielded from the mist, the place felt almost warm. She snuck in beside him and arranged the branches to better hide them.</p>\n<p>\"Lucky,\" he mumbled.</p>\n<p>\"I almost stumbled into this cave. We're going to have to make a fire, but as small as possible.\"</p>\n<p>As she spoke she opened her big pack and took out supplies. With river rocks she build a fire pit, and stacked some tinder inside it. She closed her eyes, waved her fingers, and a spark ignited the wood chips.</p>\n<p>\"I thought you couldn't use magic,\" Stanislav said.</p>\n<p>\"You've seen the height of my power, I'm afraid. Sometimes I can make a puff of wind.\"</p>\n<p>\"Can't we all.\"</p>\n<p>She rolled her eyes. \"Not <em>that</em> kind of wind. I don't suppose you have any food or water?\"</p>\n<p>He shook his head and winced. She frowned, and continued: \"We'll share, for now. I can only carry so much, so we'll have to resupply on the way.\"</p>\n<p>Stanislav asked the burning question on his mind. \"Do you even know where we're going?\"</p>\n<p>\"Not… exactly,\" she sighed. \"I'm looking for a town, but I don't know where it is. People are rather closemouthed about it, don't really blame them though.\"</p>\n<p>He raised an eyebrow. She busied herself with a small pot she hung on a blackened tripod over the fire. Filling the pot from a waterskin which she then handed to Stanislav, she unwrapped a bag of beans, dried mushrooms, and ribbons of dried carrot. From a smaller bundle she sprinkled in some herbs and stirred with a ladle which had seen better days.</p>\n<p>\"The stew will be a while so let's get comfortable in here.\"</p>\n<p>She unstrapped a single bedroll from her pack and shrugged apologetically.</p>\n<p>\"You were planning to travel the wilds alone?\" He asked.</p>\n<p>\"Or with better-equipped companions. I know,\" she said, holding up a hand to forestall additional grumbling, \"I didn't leave you much choice. I had to leave in a hurry. We'll manage. Wrap yourself up in this, will you, you look frozen to the bone.\"</p>\n<p>She handed him a big blanket, thin and lightweight but surprisingly warm. He settled on the bedroll with his back against the rounded wall of the cave, winding the blanket around him. He had not realised how cold he was, and the warmth creeping back into his body nearly lulled him to sleep. His growling stomach and pounding headache kept him awake. Yanka gave him a piece of flatbread and a chunk of dark yellow cheese. He started gnawing on the dry fare in between gulps from her waterskin. She took quick nibbles from her own food, seeming perfectly at ease in between curling roots. She had an almost dainty way of eating, he noticed, holding even a small piece of bread in both hands. Did squirrels eat like this? He fought an urge to giggle, and near choked on crumbs for his trouble. Clearing his throat, he asked:</p>\n<p>\"So you don't exactly know where this town you're looking for is. Any clues?\"</p>\n<p>\"North of Krasnograd for certain.\" She hesitated.</p>\n<p>\"Are we going north? I can't tell, with the clouds and the trees and the mist.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm sure,\" she nodded. \"The forest gives clues on where north is. Or south really, so it's a matter of turning around.\"</p>\n<p>\"Uh-huh. So about this town? Does it have a name?\"</p>\n<p>\"Volyansk,\" she said dreamily. \"People whisper it's a place of freedom, away from the nobility's eyes.\"</p>\n<p>The warmth from the blanket suddenly seemed an illusion. \"You… have trouble with the nobility?\"</p>\n<p>She looked away, then nodded once. Stanislav shivered. He knew what he had to do. Throw the blanket off, leave this place, and… return to Krasnograd? His absence would have been noticed by now; uncomfortable questions would await his return. Press on? He had no idea where north was, even by way of turning around. Alone, he'd be wandering the forest until the cold or wild beasts took him. He felt like he'd swallowed an icicle.</p>\n<p>\"You're a danger to be around,\" he hissed. \"The wardens will come for you.\"</p>\n<p>\"I know!\" She exclaimed. \"If only I could remember why! This man came to me last night, calling me Snowdrop, beckoning me to come with him.\"</p>\n<p>\"A burgher? In the middle of the night?\" Stanislav asked, more panicked than he'd been alone in the forest.</p>\n<p>\"A noble,\" she said grimly. \"No one else… looks like that. So… <em>opulent</em>. No one else has that stink.\"</p>\n<p>The world flickered before his eyes. \"You're really going to get me killed,\" he breathed.</p>\n<p>\"Not if we can find Volyansk. We'll be safe there.\"</p>\n<p>\"You don't even know where it is!\"</p>\n<p>\"I'll ask!\" She said defiantly, but her chin trembled. \"Discretely. We'll find it.\"</p>\n<p>\"I would leave you behind if I could find my way through those gods-forsaken trees.\"</p>\n<p>\"Appreciate the honesty,\" she snapped, \"but you're stuck with me for now if you don't want to be Owlbear dinner. Or snack, I suppose.\"</p>\n<p>\"Snack? Excuse you, you'll be the snack. I'm a full meal.\"</p>\n<p>\"Only with the blanket as seasoning, scrawny.\"</p>\n<p>\"At least I don't half-dissolve in the mist,\" Stanislav muttered.</p>\n<p>\"Neither do I, your cracked skull is making you see things.\"</p>\n<p>\"My skull is still as whole as they go, thank you very much.\"</p>\n<p>\"Could have fooled me,\" she grinned.</p>\n<p>He sighed and rolled his eyes, which produced a flash of pain. Groaning in surprise, he pressed cold fingers to his forehead.</p>\n<p>\"I have something for pain,\" Yanka said, digging into her pack.</p>\n<p>\"Save it,\" he said. \"I'll try to sleep, it might help.\"</p>\n<p>\"As you wish. I can keep watch a while. I hope you don't snore.\"</p>\n<p>\"I hope <em>you</em> don't snore,\" he muttered and curled up.</p>\n<p>Despite the hard stone below the bedroll, despite the cold and his hunger and headache, Stanislav fell asleep immediately.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Yanka should have been terrified. Chased by the nobility, slowed down by an injured companion, and still unable to find her lost memories, she should have been half-mad with fear. She was not. She had travelled a good amount throughout Strazhland before and she was no stranger to the cold, but it was her first time cross-country in the Krasnyles. When she'd passed through a few years prior, she had kept her eyes on the road and walked as far as she could. Now, she saw the forest. She breathed in the delicate, chilly scent of snow. It twined with a faint smell of rotting leaves, of damp soil, of wet stone. She'd always thought of herself as a city girl, but these smells were home somehow. She felt much safer than she had in Krasnograd.</p>\n<p>She leaned against the roots lining the cave wall and crossed her legs. She had never felt the need to lie down and be senseless for hours on end like other people did. She needed rest of course, but unlike humans she could spend some time sitting still and letting her thoughts drift. She did lay in beds when the opportunity was provided, if the bed was clean and somewhat comfortable. It was more relaxing than sitting. Was it an elf thing? She wasn't sure. The cave beckoned her to rest; the ground was almost soft where she'd sat, and the roots curled comfortably around her back. She kept an eye on the simmering stew, listening to Stanislav sleeping. He did snore, but not terribly loud. All the same, she hoped it wouldn't be heard outside their hiding place. That would be one way for their adventure to end…</p>\n<p>Inevitably, her thoughts turned to the silk-stinking man. The trimmed beard, the forest-green shine in his hair, the caressing voice. He had all but promised to restore her memories, not so much as a boon or a bribe but just… a fact. A minor inconvenience he would soon fix. His clothes spoke of wealth and his voice spoke of authority, but even dressed in rags and silenced he would exude overwhelming power. She knew the rumours about the nobility, of course. Everyone did, and everyone agreed to not speak of it, at least not publicly. It had become natural for her thoughts to skirt around this topic so she had to make a conscious effort to alter their flow and think on it, really think on the rumours. Yanka had once stayed a few weeks with a widow who had frequently gathered her \"knitting circle\"; in truth half the grandmothers in the village. The elf had been recovering from a nasty cold, and had the kindly old lady not treated her, she was not sure she'd be here to remember their gossiping.</p>\n<p>\"Why do you suppose the aristocrats are all young and beautiful?\" One asked, her eyes on the sock she was darning.</p>\n<p>\"Of course they aren't all young and beautiful,\" a wrinkled crone retorted. \"No one is. The ugly ones stay hidden. They're people like us, just rich.\"</p>\n<p>\"You would not say so if you had met one is person,\" Yanka's host said, waving her finger. \"Oh, my Gaspar's memory forgive me, but the one I met was a dream in velvets and fur, perfect calves and smooth hands, and eyes that made the crimson forest seem drab. He looked at me and I wished I was young and beautiful too, and he would make me a servant in his castle. I would serve tea and buttered buns to him all day.\"</p>\n<p>Another one shook her head as she worked out a tangle in her yarn. \"You're this old, and silly as a maid still. They don't make pretty people servants. They kill them for being too pretty. The aristocrats are a jealous bunch, and make no mistake.\"</p>\n<p>\"How dare you! They saved my children, when the Peryton flock attacked twenty-five winters ago, and Lady Tarasovna didn't do a thing! Now my daughter has a child of her own, and it's thanks to the nobles. They're blessed by the gods with beauty and strength, and magic that don't blow up in their faces.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's impossible,\" another snorted in between two sips of ungodly strong tea. \"Magic do blow up in everyone's face.\"</p>\n<p>\"Listen to the wizard speaking,\" her friend giggled. \"There's no magic to them. They're elves with short ears, that's all. Elves don't get old and wrinkly either. They do have the ears though, I saw them when I was still a waitress down in the docks in Krasnograd, before I married Valerian. The aristocrats just don't have the ears. They're elves.\"</p>\n<p>\"I heard a rumour,\" said a dwarven lady who was speaking up for the first time. \"My sons bring supplies to Castle Krasnograd. They say the deliveries are all wrong. The food shipments just aren't enough for the whole castle, and not fancy enough for all this nobility.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well maybe they just eat the same potatoes as us then!\"</p>\n<p>\"You're not listening,\" the dwarf whispered. \"They don't eat potatoes like us all. Why do you really think young people are disappearing?\"</p>\n<p>A hush descended over the room, and the dwarven lady waited for effect before delivering her theory: \"They eat the memories of young people. Beautiful people have easier lives, they yield the sweetest memories.\"</p>\n<p>\"You cannot be serious,\" the tea-sipping grandmother snapped. \"The aristocrats don't abduct anyone. The dwarves do, and turn them into statues.\"</p>\n<p>The dwarven lady paused in her work and shot a withering glare at her friend. Absorbed in her tea, the other woman did not notice.</p>\n<p>\"And they're not elves,\" she continued between sips, in a tone dripping with superiority. \"They're dwarves. Taller than the mountainfolk, and they shave their beards to be prettier. That's why the bearded dwarves take the beautiful ones. It's a war between them.\"</p>\n<p>\"You ever wonder,\" Yanka's host cut in, \"why they throw parties when they get married or win a battle, but never when a child is born?\"</p>\n<p>This caused another silence, eventually broken by the now much grumpier dwarven lady: \"They keep their children hidden, because… because…\"</p>\n<p>\"You have no idea,\" another snorted. \"They obviously stay indoors way too much, and die young. All the nobles do. You think I would have grown so old if I didn't walk the five miles uphill to the lake every morning? And baked the bread myself? They have others bake their bread, and they die young.\"</p>\n<p>\"You only got old because you're ugly.\"</p>\n<p>\"Who said that?!\"</p>\n<p>\"They don't die young,\" the dwarf insisted, weighing every word. \"They have powerful magic from eating sweet memories. They eat memories so they may never age, and wield magic that can kill with a thought. They're not like us, mark my words.\"</p>\n<p>The conversation devolved into squabbles, eventually shifting to safer topics. Yanka had fallen asleep then, despite being \"treated\" to the bitter tea. She was not sure how much belief she could lend to the knitting circle's tales; some rumours were definitely impossible. Magic that killed with a thought? Come <em>on</em>. But it was clear the aristocracy was of a different flesh, sibylline and distant. Another race certainly, though it did not need to mean a lot. Yanka herself was not human, and she was far from exceptional. Though one particular noble seemed to disagree with this, she thought bitterly. One of the rumours haunted her mind.</p>\n<p><em>They eat memories so they may never age.</em> Yanka half-heartedly felt for her missing memories, like fumbling in complete darkness. Of course she found nothing but a hollow filled with mist, aching sensations of familiarity, and a stab of loss. Had her memories been consumed, never to be returned again? Had the man effortlessly lied to her? It made too much sense. She felt suddenly ill, violated. She… she had to get to the bottom of this. She had to find out the truth. She felt at her head as if looking for a groove, her stomach churning in revulsion. If this was true… if the silk-stinking man had stolen her memories forever… oh, cost what it will, she <em>would</em> make him pay.</p>\n<p>For hours she was lost in dark thoughts, until her companion stirred and sat up.</p>\n<p>\"What time is it?\" He said sleepily.</p>\n<p>\"Time to be gone,\" she muttered. \"We eat, then we leave.\"</p>\n<p>\"Did you sleep?\"</p>\n<p>\"I rested.\"</p>\n<p>He looked unconvinced, but didn't pry. The stew had turned into a mushy soup and it was burnt at the bottom, so they ate what they could without scraping too much. Yanka cleaned the pot in the stream, boiled water to refill her waterskin, and packed her supplies. Stanislav stood wrapped up in his cloak, either still drowsy or merely lost in thought. They set off, and even Yanka had trouble gauging the hour. It was past midday, she decided. She remembered a village not far from here, small but they had an inn. It was home to farmers, easy to miss. Spending the night there should not get them noticed, and Stanislav looked like he could use a real bed. If she could find the north road, it would not be difficult to get to the settlement. She looked around for signs of passage and found none, but the trees seemed thinner in the east. How she knew this direction was east, with the diffuse light trickling through the clouds and mist, she wasn't sure. Yanka wasn't about to turn her nose up at a clue, however shrouded its origin.</p>\n<p>They walked in muffled silence, mist swirling around their legs and snow crunching under their boots. Even Yanka was getting too warm for comfort when she all but stumbled on a dirt path. She motioned Stanislav to stop and hide as she crept forward to scout. It was not the north road, for sure. An offshoot of it? She hoped the village was nearby. She crept through the shrubbery until she spotted fields in the distance. Rushing back to Stanislav who was resting his back against a tree, she reported on her findings.</p>\n<p>\"Not too far to these fields, we should be able to sleep in a bed tonight.\"</p>\n<p>\"I wouldn't mind that too much,\" he muttered, rubbing his temples.</p>\n<p>\"Does it still hurt?\"</p>\n<p>\"Not as much. But using magic is troublesome. It's probably nothing a little rest can't fix,\" he hastened to add. \"I did hit my head pretty hard.\"</p>\n<p>They set off down the dirt path, where only a thin layer of snow covered the hard-packed soil. After walking in deep snow for hours, Yanka felt lighter on her feet than ever. The odd sensation from earlier returned; eagerness, excitement, light-headed joy. A feeling of returning home after being away for far too long. She glanced at her companion, wondering if he shared her strange elation. Stanislav was using his staff for support despite the flat ground, but a smile tugged at the corner of his mouth.</p>\n<p>\"You seem happy,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"Happy? I don't know. More impatient, or eager I suppose. I'd never left Krasnograd before.\"</p>\n<p>\"Does it not worry you, then? You're leaving your entire life behind.\"</p>\n<p>\"It wasn't a very fulfilling life,\" he admitted. \"I was… surviving. One job after the next, just to see another day. Always keeping my head down. Hiding. Now I have a chance to walk in the open.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's not any less dangerous,\" she warned. \"We've been lucky so far, but even this close to the city, the woods are full of hungry beasts.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's not really what I mean,\" he said, looking at the darkening sky. \"You wanted me as a companion <em>because</em> I can use magic. Not in spite of it. Usually people are afraid of it; when they learn I'm a mage, they back off. Not you.\"</p>\n<p>She shrugged. \"Magic is dangerous to everyone. Even the tiny spells I can work have blown up in my face before. It's life. And besides… when we're chased by a pack of wolves, we don't care much about running through thorny bushes, right?\"</p>\n<p>\"I suppose so.\"</p>\n<p>\"So there's my reason. Your magic is a lesser evil I'm all too happy to contend with, if it can save me from the aristocrat chasing me. Or if it could help me remember.\"</p>\n<p>\"You have gaps in your memory?\" He asked.</p>\n<p>\"Yes.\" She shook her head. \"From years ago. I just remember fleeting sensations, bits and pieces. It's like my memories are choked with fog.\"</p>\n<p>They walked in silence for a moment, Stanislav looking down as he processed the information. As the forest gave way to fields, the light faded to the treacherous gloom preceding sundown.</p>\n<p>\"I tried working healing spells before,\" he said, \"but no luck somehow. I'll keep it in mind, but it's better if we find someone who knows what they're doing.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'd like that too,\" she said. \"Appreciate the intention, though.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're my boss now,\" he said absentmindedly. \"You die, I get no pay.\"</p>\n<p>\"How pragmatic.\"</p>\n<p>He shrugged. Sighing, Yanka looked around hoping to spot the village's palisade. The darkness didn't hinder her sight, but it was dreary and she longed for a bath. It wasn't yet full dark but the fields were deserted. Lonely scarecrows dotted rows of turned earth. What could grow in the deepening cold, she wondered. She wasn't curious enough to ask the locals; that would be noticed.</p>\n<p>\"Yanka?\" Stanislav said in a thin voice. \"Hurry.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why? Did you see something?\" She searched their surroundings, but nothing so much as rustled. The fields were dead silent under a blanket of mist.</p>\n<p>\"I don't like this place,\" he said and quickened his step.</p>\n<p>He was all but running and her legs were just that much shorter so she kept up at a trot, glancing on either side of the path. At this pace they quickly reached the village, which was surrounded by a deep trench. A  thick wall topped with a walkway and palisade rose from just behind the trench, which was crossed by a mouldering bridge. They were stopped at the gate before the bridge by two nervous guards.</p>\n<p>\"Travelling this late at night? Where from? Where to?\" The one asked.</p>\n<p>\"I'm going to see my sister in the country,\" Yanka replied smoothly. \"From Krasnograd.\"</p>\n<p>From the corner of her eye, she saw Stanislav shift his weight. She prayed he would catch on the tense atmosphere and remain quiet; this was no time to attract attention.</p>\n<p>\"Dangerous here at night,\" the other guard said. \"Don't be out this late. Bears and wolves. Boars are upset these days, one of the woodmen was gored last week. Ice spiders prowl.\"</p>\n<p>\"We made a push for this village,\" Yanka said. \"Didn't mean to be out this late. We're just passing through and leaving tomorrow.\"</p>\n<p>\"See that you do. We don't want trouble here. Welcome to Kratkedny.\"</p>\n<p>She bowed her head, and they were let in. Even for nightfall, the village was quiet. The main street was lit somewhat, but with the lamps few and far between, the houses were steeped in ghostly gloom. They found a hulking building with a sign hanging on creaking hinges, painted with a single, majestic turnip. Golden light seeped from under the door.</p>\n<p>\"Real beds, here we come,\" Yanka said happily.</p>\n<p>She was hoping to cheer up her companion, but with a grim expression he pushed open the door and strode in. A hush fell over the common room as they entered, giving Yanka an unpleasant shiver. She felt like she'd been caught eavesdropping. A round innkeeper walked up to them, her grey hair tied with faded ribbons on either side of a motherly face. She was smiling, but Yanka saw a glimmer of unease in her eyes.</p>\n<p>\"Welcome to the Round Turnip, my darlings,\" she said. \"It's late to be on the roads, I'd advise you avoid being out so late in the future. But you made it here safe and sound! Dinner is roasted roots, dandelion salad, and freshly smoked sausages. I have rooms with separate beds if you want to share… or one bigger bed if you are a couple.\"</p>\n<p>The innkeeper winked. Heat crept up Yanka's neck as she felt painfully aware of Stanislav standing right beside her.</p>\n<p>\"Separate beds, please,\" he said. \"We're just travelling together. And she drools in her sleep.\"</p>\n<p>She shot him a glare, but he didn't notice. He elbowed her until she took out her coin pouch, fished out silver coins, and handed them to the innkeeper who bustled away gesturing at one of the serving girls. Yanka received a key, and they both went upstairs to leave their packs and cloaks. The room barely had enough space to walk between the narrow beds and the washbasin was chipped, but it was clean and didn't smell of mould. Yanka stretched, the fatigue of the day beginning to catch up with her.</p>\n<p>\"Dinner, bath, and sleep,\" she said, stifling a yawn.</p>\n<p>\"Did you notice people getting quiet when we arrived?\" Stanislav said sombrely.</p>\n<p>\"Yes. It worries me, but what can we do about it now?\"</p>\n<p>\"Not much. Something here… unsettles me. Keep an eye open.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sure will,\" she said. \"We're not staying long anyway. We'll be gone at first light.\"</p>\n<p>\"I would prefer that, yes,\" he muttered. \"And the earlier the better. Were people insisting about the late hour? It's really not that late.\"</p>\n<p>\"They get up bright and early to work the earth, I imagine,\" she said, but it sounded unconvinced even to her.</p>\n<p>\"I do hope you know what you're doing,\" he muttered</p>\n<p>\"I know we want to leave the Krasnyles behind,\" she said. \"And leave no trace of our passage.\"</p>\n<p>\"Then I hope people didn't take as much notice as they seemed.\"</p>\n<p>\"They probably just turn in early too. Come on now, I could go for a proper meal.\"</p>\n<p>\"A meal you couldn't get a chance to burn,\" he said with a smirk.</p>\n<p>\"That was unnecessary,\" she grumbled.</p>\n<p>\"Am I wrong?\"</p>\n<p>She made a show of snorting and sulking, seeing him smirk out of the corner of her eye. Even better, as they returned to the common room for their dinner, people paid them no mind at all.</p>"
